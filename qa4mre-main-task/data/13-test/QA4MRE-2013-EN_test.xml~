Of mice and men: an Alzheimer’s cure for our murine brethren. Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, and is predicted to affect 1 in 85 people by the year 2050. And unlike stroke, prostate cancer, heart disease, and HIV, diseases in which we have made progress in treating, Alzheimer's disease has been increasing in prevalence as a cause of death. While this is probably partly due to the fact that we have been living longer and Alzheimer's is typically (but not always) a disease of the elderly, there is no denying that Alzheimer's is a disease in need of attention.  There are a few existing Alzheimer's treatments that can provide mild relief of symptoms, but none halt or even slow disease progression. Why have we not been able to come up with an effective treatment for this increasingly common disease? Here's one reason - we're not even sure what causes the disease!  A prime suspect in the disease are amyloid-beta proteins. These proteins may have accomplices that also cause Alzheimer's, but amyloid-beta proteins play a definite, if not starring role. Amyloid-beta proteins are misfolded chunks of another protein, creatively named APP for amyloid precursor protein. I use the word "chunks" because the bits of the protein that misfold and form aggregates are made up of pieces of a larger protein that gets cut up by enzymes, as shown below. What does the full-lenth amyloid precursor do as it's chilling outside the cell, all floppy and blue? (Note: proteins are not actually blue and cartoony as shown in the above figure. They are very tiny.) We don't even know that! We do know that when amyloid-beta begins to misfold, it aggregates with other proteins and that these aggregates probably cause neuron damage. Other neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or Parkinson's are also linked to these aggregates of misfolded proteins, generally called amyloids.  Get out your tarp, because this might blow your mind: what we call protein "misfolding" in Alzheimer's and other diseases may actually be related to the normal activity of these proteins! What else besides protein misfolding and neurodegneration ties together Alzheimer's, CJD, and Parkinson's? We don't know what any of the precursor proteins in those diseases as their normal functions. It COULD (big emphasis on the could) be possible that some of these proteins are meant to be sometimes be folded in the amyloid state, and that these neurodegenerative diseases are caused by an upset in the natural equilibrium of "normally folded" and "misfolded" amyloid states. I plan to blog more on protein folding and amyloids but here's a teaser for another paper I will cover - amyloid proteins may help explain how memory works.  Now that I have not-definitively-at-all covered the background of Alzheimer's, let's get to the paper I want to talk about today. This paper, "ApoE-Directed Therapeutics Rapidly Clear Β-Amyloid and Reverse Deficits in AD Mouse Models," was published in March as a ScienceExpress article. This means that the editors of the journal Science thought it was important enough to rush out and publish online. Added bonus for overworked grad students like myself - ScienceExpress papers are short! Punchline The authors of this paper do something kind of amazing - they find a drug, bexarotene, that they can give to mice with Alzheimer's and almost immediately clear out the deposits of aggregated amyloid-beta protein that build up in the brains of people and mice with Alzheimer's. Even better - this drug is already FDA approved for the treatment of cancer. And as chemotherapy drugs go, its side-effects aren't that bad, so we know we can give it to humans relatively safely.  How amazing is this drug? The authors take images of brain slices from mice pre and post treatment. Aggregates of amyloid-beta can be visualized and counted by adding a florescent antibody. After only three days, the amount of aggregated protein in both the cortex and hippocampus of affected mice has decreased by nearly half, and the decrease continues for several weeks. This is great!  The authors also show that not only do the plaques that may cause the disease dissipate, the mice also experience restored memory and cognition, which would be an amazing result if it holds in humans. In mice, building nests is a social behavior that healthy mice can perform but that Alzheimer's-affected mice cannot. After treatment with bexarotene, nest-making ability in diseased mice was restored. Bexarotene treatment also restores the sense of smell in Alzheimer's mice, another great sign because humans with Alzheimer's also experience loss of smell.  How does the drug work? There is a protein called apoE naturally expressed in your neurons. This protein gets secreted out, attaches itself to amyloid-beta aggregates, and helps break down these aggregates. apoE encourages microglia, helper cells in your brain, to eat up through phagocytosis amyloid-beta aggregates and then to break down the aggregates. Everyone's brain, even in people with Alzheimer's, already makes apoE and breaks down amyloid-beta aggregates. Alzheimer's could be caused by an inability to break down amyloid-beta fast enough (like healthy people do), so making more apoE could reverse the disease. So we have a cure for Alzheimer's right? Right! ... for mice. Anyone who's ever read about an amazing cure for a disease found in mice already knows that this cure is not likely to work in humans. Although mice have versions of 99% of the proteins we have, we also share a majority of our genome with plants. And as much as I try, laying in the sun does not make me full, just sleepy and full of vitamin D, so simply sharing similar genes does not make me the same as a mouse or plant. It's particularly tricky to translate a therapy for a neurodegenerative disease from mice to humans, since we think so differently than they do, at least based on my conversations with mice.  A further complication are the mice we perform Alzheimer's research on. In order to do this research, scientists had to create mice that could serve as models for the human disease. This was done by inserting in human genes that cause Alzheimer's, creating an imperfect model. Mice models of disease do not show all of the symptoms that humans with Alzheimer's do and may in fact be better models for early stages of disease progression than late. If so, bexarotene may be able to be used as a preventative therapy, but not as a cure.  Even with these grains of salt in mind, I still found this paper very exciting. I look forward to seeing what the results of ongoing clinical trials of bexarotene as an Alzheimer's therapy in humans will be. With a little luck, this drug can succeed where so many other promising drugs in mice have failed and become a useful therapy in humans.  If a loved one of mine had Alzheimer's, I would be watching the clinical trial results very closely.

Fighting Alzheimer’s disease? Get the immune system on board. James Fuller James Fuller discusses his research into developing antibodies against Alzheimer’s disease in the third and final highly commended article for the Max Perutz Science Writing Award 2012. Imagine living with the knowledge that over the next decade your brain will be slowly destroyed by your own body. As neurons are snuffed out like candles, what will you lose next? Will it be precious memories? The ability to perform an everyday task? Perhaps a facet of your personality? Your family and friends will have to watch helpless as the person they love is slowly eroded away. Imagine now finding out that with all of our medical expertise there is nothing we can do. Not one treatment that can slow the course of this deterioration. This is a reality for someone diagnosed with dementia. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia with an estimated 20 million sufferers worldwide, incurring a L400 billion cost to healthcare services. These figures are already frightening, but our population is getting older and the number of people with dementia will double in 30 years. The only way to prevent this is to develop new drugs to combat this devastating condition. Current therapies work by increasing certain chemicals in the brain; allowing neurons to function but not stopping them from dying. Despite a lot of research and trials of potential drugs not one therapy has been found that can slow the rate at which neurons die. So, what is holding us back from developing these new therapies? There are many problems but perhaps the biggest is that we do not fully understand how this disease works, and how to model the disease in the lab. This may be the reason why so many drugs have failed in clinical trials — clearly what we need are new approaches. By looking at the blood or brains of patients we can get an idea of what goes wrong in Alzheimer’s disease and therefore design potential new treatments. From these studies we now know that a protein called Aß for an unknown reason builds up in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients, forming large clumps called plaques. One idea suggests that the buildup of these plaques causes the destruction of neurons, and therefore removal of these plaques could protect the neurons from dying. As a result of this observation, therapies are being developed to break up these deposits or reduce the amount of Aß produced. One of the most effective and revolutionary ideas has been to “vaccinate” Alzheimer’s patients against these plaques. This is a very similar process to what happens when you are vaccinated against a disease like tuberculosis (TB). The TB vaccine teaches your immune system to recognise and remember a dead version of the bacteria which causes the disease. This means that when you encounter the real bacteria, immune cells can fight off the infection. During this process, antibodies are being produced that bind to the bacteria; the immune system is then activated to engulf and destroy the antibody-coated bacteria preventing you from getting ill. At this point you may be wondering; what does this have to do with Alzheimer’s disease? Scientists can produce antibodies in the lab that bind to almost anything: a virus, a cancer cell or even the plaques we find in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. When an Alzheimer’s patient is treated with an antibody that binds to plaques, these deposits become coated in the antibody. The subsequent immune response clears the patient’s brain of these potentially dangerous plaques. Fantastic, so we can now use these antibodies to help patients? Well not quite… while the antibody efficiently clears the plaques from the brain, the success has been tempered by side effects. To remove the antibody-coated plaques it is necessary to activate cells from the immune system and this can cause inflammation in the brain. While this inflammation is actually helpful in removing bacteria such as TB, inflammation in the brain can have severe consequences. Inflammation in Alzheimer’s patients occurs around blood vessels in the brain causing damage and bleeding, potentially inducing further deterioration and memory loss. For my PhD project I am developing new antibodies to prevent these nasty side effects. By making tiny adjustments to the structure of antibodies we can control how the immune system responds to the therapy. We are hoping that these new antibodies remove the plaques without inducing further damage to the brain. Advances in healthcare have greatly increased the length of time we live, however the quality of life we experience in our older years has not increased at the same rate. Dementia is one of science’s biggest challenges and the problem will only get worse if new therapies are not found soon. Harnessing the power of the immune system using antibodies may be one of these therapies, and this has already been an effective strategy in the treatment of bacterial infections, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. If we could make this form of therapy safe for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, it would be a good step forward to reduce the suffering of millions of patients worldwide.

Alanna Shaikh: How I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's. I'd like to talk about my dad. My dad has Alzheimer's disease. He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago, and he was officially diagnosed in 2005. Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating, he needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is or when it is, and it's been really, really hard. My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life, and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear. My dad's not alone. There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia, and by 2030 they're expecting that to double to 70 million. That's a lot of people. Dementia scares us. The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia, the big numbers of people who get it, they frighten us. And because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things: We go into denial: "It's not me, it has nothing to do with me, it's never going to happen to me." Or, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia, and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us. I'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. Prevention is good, and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's. I'm eating right, I'm exercising every day, I'm keeping my mind active, that's what the research says you should do. But the research also shows that there's nothing that will 100 percent protect you. If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you. That's what happened with my dad. My dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds. (Laughter) He got dementia anyway. If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you. Especially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families. So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father, and researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparation: I'm changing what I do for fun, I'm working to build my physical strength, and -- this is the hard one -- I'm trying to become a better person. Let's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself. You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends, because you don't know who they are. It's confusing to watch television, and often very frightening. And reading is just about impossible. When you care for someone with dementia, and you get training, they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar, hands-on, open-ended. With my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms. He was a college professor at a state school; he knows what paperwork looks like. He'll sign his name on every line, he'll check all the boxes, he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers. But it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me? I'm my father's daughter. I read, I write, I think about global health a lot. Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins? Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color? So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on. I've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it. I am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box. (Laughter) And I'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blob. But, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it. Because the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do, the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore. They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier, easier for their caregivers to look after, and it may even slow the progress of the disease. That all seems like win to me. I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can. A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms, as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance, you get muscle tremors, and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile. They get scared to walk around. They get scared to move. So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance. I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it, I'll still be able to be mobile. I'm doing weight-bearing exercise, so that I have the muscle strength so that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move around. Finally, the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person. My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's, and he's kind and loving now. I've seen him lose his intellect, his sense of humor, his language skills, but I've also seen this: He loves me, he loves my sons, he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers. And that love makes us want to be around him, even now. even when it's so hard. When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world, his naked heart still shines. I was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as loving. And what I need now is to learn to be like that. I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia, it will survive. I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease. What I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me. But if it comes for me, I'm going to be ready. Thank you. (Applause)

Financial challenges faced by person with dementia. The idea: A person with dementia and the family face many financial challenges. We need to emphasize economies of the cost of care. My name is Mike Donohue. I am just short of 75 years old, having been diagnosed five years ago. I have atypical AD. It is A-Typical because it is somewhat different than the norm. My memory is more intact than many, my cognition remains good as does my ability to read and write. Other limitations of the Alzheimer’s kind I do have. These keep me from driving, biking, handling money and doing more than one thing at a time. Alz.Org and other professional, social and charitable organizations, need to concentrate on formulating and developing programs of care that offer greater economy than those as now exist.  When a family is faced with its diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease it faces a variety of issues that need immediate resolution. One of these is the handling of their estate (their saved living and retirement funds) which may be irretrievably altered by reason of the current prognosis for care of the Alzheimer’s afflicted.   Financial Issues of First Facing This Disease.  Of the many things that need to be dealt with will be the following:     What will happen if the care needed has cost which the family is not able to pay?      Is there long term health coverage to pay this?     Does Normal Health Care coverage or Medicare provide any help?     Is the Alzheimer Afflicted able to continue working, earning the same salary? Is the spouse working earning income, is that enough to currently support the family?     If income of one subsides or of all of them reduce will the family be able to make it?     Where does the family go to fill the gap?  The Answers To These Questions Are Not Pretty!     The family’s private funds are normally the first source for payment of any cost of care not immediately covered by the insurance of the family.     Long Term Health Care coverage, if sufficient, if it specifically makes provisions, and is designed to run a sufficiently long time, will pay cost of care in the home and out of home care provided by agencies qualifying for reimbursement. This applies to most institutional Nursing Home and Assisted Living Facilities. It may apply to some day care and group home settings.     Health Care coverage and Medicare do not pay anything but immediate hospital and medically-related expenses provided as part of treatment. This most often does not include Nursing Home, Assisted Living facilities or equivalent styles of In House or Away from Home kinds of help.      In the event of diminution in earnings in the household because of the disease the private funds of the families are the first if not only source to make up the difference. Charitable or public assistance is predicated on the inability to pay and in many cases is difficult to get unless there is no other way.     If the family cannot make it, Public Assistance is available as well as assistance from many giving groups.     The problem is for those in-between.  Available Options. Long term health care seems worth every penny paid for it, if you have it. If you do not, with an Alzheimer’s diagnosis it is unlikely you can get it. But, remember, you get what you pay for, no more, no less. If you were smart enough and have it be sure it pays enough. Be sure it runs long enough. Be sure it covers Home, Assisted Living and Nursing Home Care.      Living Care: Some reimbursement of institutional Home care is pretty basic to all of the long term policies. Be sure in addition they cover cost of home care and cost of out of the home care not the normal institutional Nursing or Assisted Living care. Look at the type and kind of services it pays for. Does it pay for the normal group home, called foster home in some states? What are the qualifications, if any, for the home should payment for it be sought? The same applies to Home Care. Is the person who comes in to provide care qualified, certified, or, can just anyone provide the service required by simpler needs such as attendance, cooking, cleaning etc.?      Financial Planning:     Some financial planning with an expert is recommended. This is most important when it comes to evaluating the availability of Public Assistance. A need for care does not automatically produce Public Assistance. The law is very specific in determining where and how you qualify for it before you can get it.      In most cases the funds of the husband and wife seeking assistance (their entire estate) cannot exceed a little more than $100,000 between them. This may seem to be enough. It is not when you stop to consider this:  When the need for Assistance kicks in the current needs of the family don’t disappear, they continue. As an example: The husband, no longer earning income, needs daily attendant care. If the wife is home, able to give it that is not a new cost. In this situation the couple's living conditions do not change, they continue as they were.   The cost incident to the disease only goes up and too often is your obligation alone. What this means is: your current cost of living does not go down, if anything it goes up. Current cost of living mean the expenses other than the care expenses, such as home mortgage, monthly budget, the cost of the spouse not needing Care. These costs continue during the lifetime of both the husband and the wife. Circumstances change what those costs might be. They can go up, they can go down. We of course know their usual direction.  They will go down if the husband needs to go into assisted living or nursing home or some other out of home care facility. Without regard to who pays the cost of this the expenses do go down for the wife to the extent she no longer has to pay the eating and living expenses of the husband. She need no longer pay those costs incidental to his living at home. These are the only costs that stop.  When the husband dies the wife’s financial needs do not change appreciably with respect to herself. They continue. They continue her life time.  Now we come to totaling all of this to see how long that $100,000 lasts. Pull out your budget. What do you pay a month, a year? What of it will change if at all when one of you enters institutional care? Of the fixed amounts multiply them by the number of years of life expectancy the survivor is likely to live. Will it last?    Who Pays The Cost?  As these extra expenses escalate, who pays for them? You do. When can you ask for help? Anytime, anywhere, anyone can be asked. When are you entitled to help? Only when you have reached what the law calls the “Poverty Threshold.”  This threshold is when you own no more than around $103,000 total value of everything the husband and wife have. It was this amount when I checked with the experts in 2007. I believe it remains the same four years later.  Everything you have is just that! This includes bank accounts, retirement accounts face value of insurance policies, pension plans of which you are the owner not employer provided.   There are exclusions, not many, nonetheless there are. Your homestead up to $500,000 in some cases others up to 1,000,000 in value are excluded so long as the other spouse remains living in it. Certain annuities if they fit within a rigid definition of “purchase of income flow only annuities” with no right or restricted right of beneficiary appointment, these are excluded from the calculation of your estate.  If you have given it away more than five years before application for assistance is made it might qualify. By giving it away they mean just that. You must relinquish all incidents of ownership and control. This is available for irrevocable trusts only. It does not include revocable trusts. The law examines an irrevocable trust to see whether or the owner(s) have given up all control and no longer own the assets in an irrevocable trust. The essence in a revocable trust is that it can be revoked by the owner(s) and the assets returned to them.   Change.  What is needed is change.      Change in the style and cost of care.      Change finding more economical care.     Change of the existing infrastructure responding to the present needs produced by Alzheimer’s, not continuing to do something they do because that is the way they always did it.     Change of Public Assistance in the current compensation formulas.  These changes can run anywhere from qualification to supplemental provisions taking the form of more tax deduction and credit allowances, credits or incentives for public, private and non-profit ventures all directed to reducing the cost and increasing the availability of help for families faced with the overwhelming task of accommodating the alteration in their lives caused by Alzheimer’s.  It Is in the Public’s Interest.  It is in the public’s interests this be done. Alzheimer’s disease presents our short term future with a financial crisis that will devastate our already exhausted private and public capacity to pay its cost.  Proposals for Change.  What are sorely needed are lower-level care facilities and assistance programs. In whatever form, we need to consider and seek out greater economy of care in a variety of methods. We need to find alternatives to the high cost of institutional nursing home and assisted living of the facilities now provided.   Kinds of Care.  These can be but not limited to boarding and care homes, co-ops, foster homes, mutual help programs of people buying or renting a group home or grouping in same location apartments to hire and manage their own needs. Programs to support this are needed to help organize, facilitate and maintain these kinds of alternative care approaches. These could be supplied by private enterprise, charitable institutions or some lower level function than the Federal Government. This is being done in some areas; so much more is needed.   Tax Treatment.  Tax breaks and other public incentives are needed.  By history there has been a concentration of effort to remove any opportunity of anyone avoiding their personal obligation to pay for institutional care by forcing the government to do so. The history arose when the folks gave the farm to the kids, moved into the Nursing Home and applied for Old Age Assistance. They transferred the farm before they went in to avoid the county putting an Old Age Assistance Lien on it.  This may be as it ought to be. Nonetheless if private estates must first be drained of the funds needed by those depending on the person needing care, those dependents will continue to have the same economic need during and after the care is given the one in need of it.   The epidemic proportions of the issues associated with Alzheimer’s disease need attention. Tax deduction is needed for in home care, day care, respite care, any care in other forms. Deduction allowance is needed for the cost of care facilities. There needs to be a scheme to reward economy of costs in providing services. Other tax benefits are needed for programs to supplant the need of public funding for care. These need to be explored and the best of them provided.   Current Tax Treatment.  Although some deduction of cost of care facilities exists it is not clear, and too often is increased by the qualification processes that are needed so the deduction can be taken. This raises the cost of the service prohibitively.  Once qualified it is a question whether or not the person needing such care can deduct it if someone else made the payment for the service? Is the patient needing the care qualified to deduct it or is it the deduction of the caregiver requiring the additional help or making the payment? Can anyone deduct if they pay it? Who determines the qualification of the person in need before any deduction can be taken?  The tax breaks depend on the taxpayer entitled to the break having the income from which to take the break or income tax liability from which to take a credit. Many on fixed income fall between the cracks. They have too little income from too much estate to qualify for public assistance. This is but one of those open cracks. Some scheme of credits, rebates or something more direct needs to be considered for those who do not benefit from the deduction credit allowed against taxable income or tax liability.  Change Will Save The System.  We need to find a more economical way of providing care and respite for the Afflicted and the Affected before the Cost of Care bankrupts the system and puts everyone out in the street. The problems today with cost of living, health care and insurance costs, medical and hospital costs, the inability of our politicians to get it together in any meaningful way demonstrate what will come. Gridlock!  The prospect of what we all will face is magnified by the inability of our culture, institutions and governmental processes to provide care. The current insurmountable costs we have caring for ourselves without Dementia, namely living day to day, is already insurmountable. Keeping a job, paying the bills as middle class is squeezed into poverty class complicates it. This with all of the other difficulties creates an impossible situation. How then are we to meet this coming crises bearing down on us at breakneck speed?   If we are unable to find a cure for this disease quickly there will be no funds left with which to seek Economy of Care. The coming increase of people needing care because of this disease is frightening.

Johann Baptist Cramer. Johann Baptist Cramer was born in Mannheim on 24 Feb 1771 and died in London on 16 April 1858. He was a composer, pianist and publisher, the eldest son of Wilhelm Cramer. He was the most outstanding member of the family. As one of the most renowned piano performers of his day, he contributed directly to the formulation of an idiomatic piano style through his playing and his compositions. When he was about three years old he was taken to London by his mother to join his father, who had decided to establish himself in England. Wilhelm taught his son the violin from a very early age, but the child showed distinct precocity at the piano and at the age of seven was placed under the direction of J.D. Benser. He continued his studies with J.S. Schroeter from 1780 to 1783, when he was entrusted to Muzio Clementi. Although he studied with Clementi for only one year, the lessons were decisive in forming his artistic character. His formal training was completed with lessons in theory (from 1785) under C.F. Abel, through whom Cramer first came to know the writings of Kirnberger and Marpurg. His early training acquainted him with the works of the greatest keyboard composers of the century, and by the mid-1780s he had studied works of Clementi, Schröter, J.C. Bach, C.P.E. Bach, Domenico Scarlatti, Müthel, Paradies, Haydn and Mozart. He may have been introduced to Das wohltemperirte Clavier as early as 1787, and he developed a lifelong fascination for Bach. By the time Clementi left England for the Continent and Cramer's formal piano lessons were abruptly ended, he had already attracted attention as a performer in London. He made his formal début on 6 April 1781, appearing in his father's annual benefit concert. He performed occasionally during the next few years, at one concert (in 1784) playing a duet for two pianos with Clementi.  In 1788 Cramer undertook his first foreign tour and visited the major cities of France and Germany, including Paris and Berlin. While in France he was given a number of J.S. Bach's manuscripts. His earliest compositions were also published during his stay in France. On his return to England in 1791 he immediately began an active performing career, and during the next nine seasons established himself as England's most remarkable young pianist, capable of providing stiff competition for the older virtuosos. He participated as a soloist in both major series, the Professional Concert and the Salomon Concerts, as well as appearing in numerous benefit concerts. He made the acquaintance of all the eminent artists who appeared in London during that decade, including Haydn, and he began to gain recognition as a composer and teacher.  Cramer left London in 1799 for a second journey that included the Netherlands, Germany and Austria. He met Beethoven in Vienna, initiating a warm and mutually rewarding relationship, and he renewed his friendly association with Haydn. On his return to England in 1800 he married almost immediately. The activities of his first 30 years had brought him into contact with nearly all the most prominent musicians of Europe, including Hummel, Dussek, Weber, Kalkbrenner, Cherubini and Wölfl, in addition to those already mentioned. In later years he came to know Ries, Czerny, Moscheles, Mendelssohn, Liszt and Berlioz. He championed with characteristic vigour the works of composers whom he admired; his performances of Bach and Mozart, in particular, created great excitement, and he helped to introduce Beethoven's sonatas to English audiences. His impact as a popularizer of music by other composers seems to have been felt as much by his playing at private gatherings as by his concert appearances, for he preferred private music-making, even when travelling abroad.  After 1800 Cramer's public career was centred almost entirely on England. He taught privately at least into the 1820s, commanding the top fee of one guinea per lesson. But he travelled again from 1816 to 1818, visiting Amsterdam and Mannheim. While abroad he continued to renew and expand his associations, but his public performances were apparently rare. His mature years in London were marked by many signs of high regard. To admiring English audiences he was their "Glorious John", and his appearances continued to stir excitement until his formal retirement. He was one of the founders of the Philharmonic Society in 1813, and he was appointed to the board of the RAM on its foundation in 1822.  Following the very successful example of Clementi, Cramer entered the music publishing business. His earliest ventures included a partnership known as Cramer &amp; Keys in 1805, and another partnership with Samuel Chappell (later of Chappell) from 1810 to 1819. A more lasting firm was established in 1824 (when Cramer joined Robert Addison and T.F. Beale), at a later date known as j.b. Cramer &amp; co. ltd, which flourished from its first days and still exists.  Cramer married for the second time in 1829, and he retired officially from public life after a gala farewell concert in 1835. His next decade included visits to Munich and Vienna and a long residence in Paris, but he returned again to England in 1845 and remained there for the rest of his life. He died at his house in Kensington and was buried in the Brompton Cemetery.  The large volume of Cramer's compositions is only part of his musical achievement. His playing left a permanent impression on several generations of early 19th-century pianists. He received almost universal admiration for his playing; even Beethoven considered him the finest pianist of the day, according to Ries. His expressive legato touch, which later became a stylistic norm among pianists, was especially admired: in Moscheles's words, his legato "almost transforms a Mozart Andante into a vocal piece". His refinement in improvisation and the remarkable independence of his fingers were equally renowned; they are also evidence of his Classical ideals and distinguish him from more dramatically inclined later generations. By the end of his long career his playing may have become somewhat outmoded. Certainly Wilhelm von Lenz found his playing in the 1840s dry and harsh, though at the same time August Gathy contradicted Lenz's judgment. Cramer himself noted the changing fashions when he described earlier playing as "fort bien" ("very good") and the newer style as "bien fort" ("very strong").  Many aspects of Cramer's compositional style are strikingly conservative. He apparently liked to view himself as a latter-day Mozartian, preserving Mozart's grace, elegance and clarity. His music is generally less dramatic than Clementi's, less rich than Dussek's, less sentimental than Field's. The originality of his genius appears principally in his combination of a conservative bias with the most advanced, idiomatically pianistic passage-work. Although there is an inconsistency in the quality of his works that was observed even by critics of his day, his music is nearly always skilful, pleasant and sophisticated, and his ingenuity in passage-work expanded the vocabulary of colourful and evocative sonorities available to the piano.  Cramer's affinity for certain Classical ideas did not prevent him from assimilating the newer musical forms that became popular in the early 19th century, and his own work accurately reflects the changing tastes of the period.  Nearly all his 117 sonatas, for example, were written before 1820, and his production of didactic works, capriccios, fantasias and small pieces based on popular tunes increased markedly after 1810. He supplied so much music for the dilettante that by the end of the century his name was used in France as a pseudonym for musical trifles.  Of all Cramer's works, the one that has had the greatest enduring value is his celebrated set of 84 studies for the piano, published in two sets of 42 each in 1804 and 1810 as "Studio per il pianoforte". This collection has long been considered a cornerstone of pianistic technique and is the only work of Cramer's that is generally known today. Clementi claimed for himself the idea of such a comprehensive technical volume, accusing Cramer of having stolen the idea and title for the "Studio". Cramer's work inspired many similar efforts, some being mere imitations. Soon after its appearance, Steibelt and Wölfl produced sets of studies, and Clementi eventually published his Gradus ad Parnassum.  Nevertheless, Cramer's "Studio" was the most widely used and admired collection in the early 19th century. Beethoven annotated 21 of the studies for his nephew's use (published in an edition by J.S. Shedlock in 1893) and considered them "the best preparation for his own works". Schumann described the "Studio" as the finest training "for head and hand". The studies are structurally simple; each is based on a characteristic pattern or mechanical problem, and although the shadows of Bach and Domenico Scarlatti are often apparent, the harmonic colouring and figurational variety in the "Studio" are eminently modern and entirely suited to the piano. The success of the studies led Cramer to produce many more methods, including the "Anweisung das Pianoforte zu spielen", which includes rules for fingering and the use of the pedals. Some of the later studies were given individual descriptive titles, in keeping with the fashion, but none of them matched the "Studio" in usefulness and artistic merit.  The scope and seriousness of Cramer's compositions often varies widely within a single category; even among the sonatas and concertos the range is considerable.  The best of the shorter pieces anticipate the general features of the character piece in form and expressiveness, while many works were plainly directed to the unsophisticated amateur. The sonatas, in spite of their diminishing numbers in Cramer's later years, contain some of his most impressive achievements. There is some evidence that Beethoven occasionally borrowed from Cramer's sonatas, and Schumann considered Cramer and Moscheles the only outstanding sonata composers of their generation.  The accompanied sonatas, which comprise less than half the total number, are generally lighter and more popular in character than the solo sonatas. After 1800 Cramer showed a clear preference for solo works, although some of the later solo sonatas still have some popular features, such as the inclusion of "favourite airs". The sonatas written after 1810 are more consistently serious and contain more prominent Romantic characteristics. Several have descriptive titles ("Il mezzo", "Le retour à Londres") and a highly flexible, dramatic approach to the use of compass and texture. In harmonic daring they show the impact of Beethoven, and they abound in sweeping, colouristic accompanimental patterns.  Cramer's late sonatas were occasionally reprinted in the 19th century, but they have passed into obscurity in more recent times.  Copyright (C) Oxford University Press 2007-2013.

Electronic music. Electronic music intended primarily for dancing at nightclubs and raves. Electronic dance music (EDM), or simply "dance music", is characterized by rapid evolution - hundreds of subgenres and hybrid genres have been created since its inception in the 1980s. Whereas EDM has achieved widespread popularity in Europe and the UK, it remains a comparatively underground phenomenon in the United States. The production and distribution of EDM has not been particularly adaptable to the American music industry, whose practices have been largely shaped by rock and pop. In addition, because EDM does not follow a standard song structure and often features very lengthy tracks, it does not easily lend itself to commercial radio. Ironically, while EDM culture operates below the radar in the United States, it can be heard frequently in American television programs, films, advertisements, and video games.  EDM is produced "from the beats up", in that melodies, vocals and sound effects are layered over a steady beat. A notable feature of many EDM tracks is the utilization of Sampling and sequencing, hip hop, a practice in which a discrete portion of sound is recorded and then inserted into a new piece of music. Ethical and legal issues notwithstanding, EDM producers and DJs capitalize on the creative impulse to reuse, recycle, or rework previously created material.  1. Roots  Some of the earliest structures and concepts that inform EDM production include Italian futurist Luigi Russolo's "noise music" (1913). Russolo created instruments that reproduced the sounds of industry and machines (intonarumori), and composed pieces incorporating these sounds. The concept of music as the sound of everyday life reappeared in 1948, as experimentalist composers Pierre Henry and Pierre Schaeffer pioneered a technique of musical composition called musique concrète. Various sounds were recorded onto reel-to-reel tape, which was cut and spliced together to construct a piece of music. The advent of digital sampling in the 1980s made this process easier and more deliberate.  In the 1970s Jamaican-born Kool herc, a pioneering hip-hop DJ, invented a practice similar to sampling. Calling his technique "the merry-go-round", Herc would place two copies of the same record on two separate turntables, so that he could play the drum break on one copy and replay it on the other copy, creating the effect of a continuous loop. DJs such as Grandmaster Flash continued Herc's practice of looping drum breaks on two turntables, making it quicker and more precise. This technique has proven highly influential to EDM producers, many of whom began using looped drum breaks as the basis of their tracks. (See also Turntablism.)  In the 1960s and 1970s, Jamaican dub reggae producers like Osbourne "King Tubby" Ruddock, and Lee "Scratch" Perry produced remixes (or "versions") of reggae singles - a practice that would later be adopted by EDM producers and DJs. King Tubby also experimented with various studio techniques that emphasized bass frequencies, so that his tracks would make a greater impact when played on sound systems at dance parties. The emphasis placed on bass in a dance party environment has carried over into EDM and rave culture.  The early sound of EDM, especially electro and techno, owes a great debt to the German group Kraftwerk. In addition to making extensive use of electronic instruments - synthesizers, drum machines, and vocoders - the group perpetuated a mythos about technology and the future in songs such as "Trans-Europe Express" and "Autobahn". The disco producer Giorgio Moroder's work in the late 1970s was also influential. Moroder eschewed the symphonic flourishes of early disco in favor of an overtly electronic, "futuristic" sound, which relied heavily on sequencers. The 1977 smash hit "I Feel Love" was entirely synthesized, with the exception of Donna Summer's vocals. The Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra and British synth-pop groups such as the Human League and Depeche Mode also influenced many early producers of EDM.  2. Technologies.  EDM was initially created with drum machines, sequencers and synthesizers. The proliferation of cheap, portable synthesizers in the early 1980s - most famously the Roland TB-303 "bass synthesizer" and the Roland TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines - allowed synthesizer-based music to move from research labs, recording studios, and concert halls to more casual, egalitarian confines. (See Synthesizer.) The Linn LM-1 Drum Computer, the first drum machine to use digital samples, was introduced in 1980 at a retail price of around $5000; its successor, the Linn Drum, released in 1982, was somewhat more affordable. While the Linn Drum gained favor with popular mainstream artists such as Prince and the Human League, its price was still out of reach for the average producer. The Roland TR-808, which would become a bedrock of techno, hip-hop and house music, retailed at one-fifth the price of the LM-1, around $1,000 upon its initial release in 1980. It was an analog drum machine, which produced tinny, less realistic drum sounds than the Linn LM-1, which sampled acoustic instruments.  But its price, ease of use (its colored buttons made it look like a toy) and distinctive presets, such as the cowbell sound, made it extremely popular. EDM's growth was also spurred by the introduction of the MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) protocol in 1983. MIDI allowed subsequent drum machines such as the Roland TR-909 to synchronize easily with other electronic devices. (See Electronic percussion.)  Since the early 1990s, computer software has greatly facilitated EDM production.  Programs like Reason, Cubase, and Ableton Live provide producers with a virtual sequencer, sampler, drum machine, and soundbank of a wide range of musical instruments. Such equipment enables producers easily to incorporate various effects such as reverb, delay, compression and equalization.  3. EDM in performance.  Electronic dance music's performance in nightclubs has traditionally relied on DJs mixing 12-inch vinyl records on two turntables. This common setup was used by pioneering disco and hip-hop DJs in the 1970s to construct continuous mixes for dancers. Disco DJs such as Francis Grasso and Larry Levan advanced new turntable techniques designed to meet the demands of the dance floor. Grasso pioneered "slip-cueing" - holding the vinyl record still with his hand while the platter continued to turn underneath, allowing the record to be cued at a specific time. Grasso also helped develop the technique of "beatmatching" - matching the tempo of two records with each other, on two turntables, allowing for seamless mixing. Levan constructed continuous DJ mixes stretching over several hours at the legendary Paradise Garage club in downtown Manhattan in the mid-1970s, augmented with live effects and creative use of crossfaders and equalizers. (See also DJ (ii).)  The main purpose of an EDM DJ, in a club or at a rave, is to take listeners/dancers on a type of musical journey. Because EDM is most often played for long stretches of time, DJs have to pace their sets by playing a combination of uptempo and downtempo music. Typically, a DJ begins with slower, mellow tracks, then gradually builds energy on the dancefloor with louder, faster and more well-known tracks. Experienced DJs have perfected the art of reading a crowd, choosing tracks whose style and character serve to maintain activity on the dancefloor through musical peaks and valleys. Yearly large-scale EDM festivals such as Winter Music Conference, Movement: Detroit's Electronic Music Festival, Moogfest and Electric Zoo Festival feature both EDM pioneers and upcoming DJs and producers.  4. EDM genres.  Electro, short for "electro-funk", was the first electronic dance music genre of the 1980s to gain wide appeal. The sound of electro was brittle, spacey and completely electronic, often lyrically infused with sci-fi or futuristic themes.  The Roland TR-808 was the drum machine of choice in most early electro tracks, and vocals were often fed through a vocoder to generate an eerie, robotic effect. Electro exhibited a good deal of crossover with early hip-hop, emblematized by "Planet Rock" (1982) by Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force, Produced by Arthur Baker, the song paid literal tribute to Kraftwerk by incorporating elements of two of their songs, "Trans-Europe Express" and "Numbers". The seminal Detroit electro group Cybotron, formed in 1980 by Juan Atkins and Richard "3070" Davis, helped pave the way for the subsequent growth of Detroit techno.  Techno and house music were birthed in the Midwest; techno was invented in Detroit in the early 1980s, and house was a product of Chicago in the mid-1980s.  Named for their neighborhood west of Detroit, the "Belleville Three" - Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, and Derrick May - were associated most strongly with techno's roots. Though producers such as May were associated with a more lyrical, soulful version of techno music, techno, for the most part, implied a harder sound, underpinned with a steady 4/4 beat hovering between 120-140 beats per minute. In contrast, house music, which owed more to the legacy of disco, was slightly slower in tempo and more likely to incorporate vocals, strings, and other flourishes.  The term "house" is said to have come from the Warehouse club in Chicago, where house pioneer Frankie Knuckles was the resident DJ. In Chicago venues such as the Warehouse and the Music Box, this emerging sound flourished, fostered by ace DJs like Frankie Knuckles and the late Ron Hardy, and furthered by labels such as Trax and DJ International. House wasn't one sound, but a wide panorama of sounds, encompassing everything from the tender, moving melodies of Larry Heard to the twitchy, futuristic "acid house" of Phuture. House music, in its early days, often sported this signature "acid" sound - the rubbery, "squelchy" timbres of the Roland TB-303. Acid house would gain major commercial success in the UK a few years later, dovetailing with the rave movement that exploded in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Street drugs like LSD, mushrooms, and most notably MDMA (ecstasy), became increasingly popular with EDM audiences. MDMA had a particular synergy with electronic dance music for a number of reasons. First, as a psychedelic amphetamine, it offered a powerful stimulant for late-night DJ sets in clubs that fueled dancers well into the morning. Second, its mechanism of action - which causes the release of large amounts of the feel-good chemical serotonin, along with the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine - led to feelings of profound euphoria, empathy, and intimacy. The drug's array of physiological and psychological effects worked in tandem with acid house DJ sets, sending dancers on a musical and emotional journey. In London, clubs such as the exceedingly popular Shoom, were the gateway to rave culture, which soon became a global movement.  Rave culture grew as well in response to the UK's high population density and its network of pirate radio stations that promoted EDM. By 1991, there were reports of up to 50,000 people attending large open-air raves in the UK. In the United States, rave culture spread more sporadically, in part because of strong competition with West Coast hip hop, alternative rock, and grunge. The closest that EDM came to being a mainstream phenomenon in the United States was in the 1990s, when music videos by acts such as the Chemical Brothers and the Prodigy became mainstays on MTV rotation. As the 1990s progressed, acid house, techno, and breakbeat hardcore (a genre based on drum breaks from funk and soul records) morphed and merged, creating ghettotech and ghetto house, Miami bass, Baltimore club, trance (or psytrance) and drum 'n' bass (or jungle). EDM continued to grow and splinter, producing new subgenres such as techstep, 2-step, so-called "intelligent dance music" or IDM, glitch, and so on. In the 21st century, genres such as grime and dubstep have attracted audiences in the UK as well as the United States and abroad.  With the advent of the digital work station, cheap mixing/recording software, Internet exchange boards and self-distribution, the start-up costs for a prospective EDM producer are much lower than ever before. So it is not a surprise today to find new forms of EDM being produced all over the world, from India to South Africa, Israel to Japan and beyond. Incorporating traditional and popular musics close to home, artists such as Talvin Singh, Badmarsh and Shri, Cheb i Sabbah, Transglobal Underground, Banco de Gaia, and Fun-Da-Mental, have created versions of EDM that reflect their local experiences and identity. In this way, EDM has truly become a global phenomenon.  Copyright (C) Oxford University Press 2007-2013.

Film Music. 3. Hollywood.  The major Hollywood studios of the so-called Golden Age (c1935-55) were MGM, Paramount, RKO, Warner Brothers and 20th Century-Fox. Each housed a permanent music department, with contracted composers, arrangers, orchestrators, librarians and music editors, as well as a resident orchestra, all working under a senior music director. The heavy emphasis on commercially viable narrative films, and intense pressures on production staff to maintain a prolific output, inevitably led to stereotyped scoring in which the work of one composer was readily interchangeable with another's; many low-budget movies were "tracked" with music from previous productions until this practice was prohibited in 1944.  The majority of early composers shared Steiner's European and/or Broadway background, and moved with ease from high Romanticism to Gershwinesque symphonic jazz as required. Steiner won RKO an Academy Award for his score to "The Informer" in 1935; the best-score category had been introduced in the previous year, and for the first four years of its existence it was awarded to studio music departments, not composers. In his later music for romantic melodramas, including "Gone with the Wind" (1939), Steiner preserved a link with silent-cinema traditions by incorporating allusions to easily recognizable melodies such as Civil War songs and national anthems where dramatically justified. In "Casablanca" (1942) he transformed the diegetic popular song "As Time Goes By" to provide narrative comment in the background score.  The conventions of the "classical" Hollywood film score in the Golden Age - essentially a leitmotif-based symphonic romanticism with narrative orientation, the music almost always subordinated to the primacy of the visual image and dialogue - prevailed in scores by other expatriate musicians. Work for European immigrants was promoted by the European Film Fund (founded in 1939), an initiative followed by MGM and Warner Brothers. At Warner, the Viennese composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold provided flamboyant scores to the series of Errol Flynn costume dramas including "Captain Blood" (1935), "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938) and "The Sea Hawk" (1940), bringing the romantic-operatic style to its early highpoint. The German-born composer Franz Waxman developed a style of underscoring suited to the horror genre pioneered by Universal, where he was head of the music department, an early example being James Whale's "The Bride of Frankenstein" (1935); Waxman also exploited pre-existing musical structures such as fugue and passacaglia where these suited the narrative. The Hungarian composer Miklós Rózsa (who had worked for his compatriot, the producer Alexander Korda, in London before moving to Hollywood in 1939) and Dimitri Tiomkin (originally a silent-cinema pianist in Russia) both proved exceptionally versatile. Rózsa served as Professor of Film Music at the University of Southern California from 1945 to 1965, and his scores for epic productions in the 1950s were especially influential (see below). The success of Tiomkin's score to the western "High Noon" (1952) initiated a craze for the "theme score", based largely on a main-title melody or song. Other immigrant composers included Daniele Amfitheatrof, Adolph Deutsch, Ernest Gold, Werner Heymann, Friedrich Hollaender, Bronislaw Kaper and Cyril Mockridge; their American contemporaries included George Antheil (also an early film-music critic), David Buttolph, Hugo Friedhofer, John Green and Ray Heindorf (the two last specializing in musicals), Herbert Stothart and Victor Young.  The leading native American film composer in this period was Alfred Newman, another musician who had moved from Broadway to Hollywood. Newman was music director at 20th Century, for which he composed his famous fanfare in 1935, the year in which the company merged with Fox; he held the music directorship of 20th Century-Fox from 1939 until 1960. By his death in 1970 he had completed over 200 scores (of which the last was "Airport" in 1969) and received nine Academy Awards and 45 nominations. (The Newman family has remained prominent in Hollywood to this day: Lionel Newman was Alfred's brother, David and Thomas Newman are his sons and Randy Newman his nephew). In addition to his creative achievements, Newman was renowned as a sensitive music director and talent-spotter, and furthered the careers of young native talents such as David Raksin and Jerry Goldsmith. Raksin established his reputation with an inventive score to the unorthodox detective thriller "Laura" (1944), important equally for its near monothematicism (the main-title theme became a hit when lyrics were added by Johnny Mercer after the film's release), its subtle blurring of the distinction between diegetic and extra-diegetic music, and its canny blending of popular and art-music styles. In the wartime genre of film noir underscoring achieved a harmonic and textural sophistication (including novel instrumental colours and expressionistic dissonances) generally lacking in other genres. Fine examples were composed by Rózsa ("Double Indemnity", 1944) and Roy Webb ("Farewell my Lovely", 1944; "The Spiral Staircase", 1945).  Copland's film scores - including "Of Mice and Men" and "Our Town" (both 1940), "The Red Pony" and "The Heiress" (both 1949) - encouraged American composers to explore a new clarity of texture and simple diatonicism. The strong flavour of American folk music in this style, which extends back to Virgil Thomson's score for the Depression documentary "The Plow that Broke the Plains" (1936) and was later represented by Friedhofer's to "The Best Years of our Lives" (1946), made it well suited to rural or western scenarios; it had a significant impact on scores for the latter genre composed by Jerome Moross, whose music for "The Big Country" (1958) was widely imitated, and Elmer Bernstein ("The Magnificent Seven", 1960; "True Grit", 1969). Bernstein's work in the 1950s often favoured smaller instrumental ensembles than the traditional studio orchestras, and his output has remained prolific and varied.  Dissonant modernism came to the fore in a high-profile score by Leonard Bernstein ("On the Waterfront", 1954) and in Leonard Rosenman's partly atonal music for the James Dean vehicles "East of Eden" and "Rebel without a Cause" (both 1955), strongly influenced by Berg and the Second Viennese School; the gritty realism of the director Elia Kazan stimulated this trend. Serial techniques were occasionally employed: examples include Rosenman's "The Cobweb" (1955) and "Fantastic Voyage" (1966), Rózsa's portrayal of Satanic elements in "King of Kings" (1961) and Jerry Fielding's "Straw Dogs" (1971). The career of Bernard Herrmann, who provided critically acclaimed scores for the directors Orson Welles ("Citizen Kane", 1941; "The Magnificent Ambersons", 1942), Alfred Hitchcock ("Vertigo", 1958; "North by Northwest", 1959; "Psycho", 1960), François Truffaut (see §4) and Martin Scorsese ("Taxi Driver", 1976), set a new standard in essentially non-thematic but highly atmospheric and economical underscoring, with dissonant harmonies, resourceful instrumentation and often disquieting ostinato figurations.  In the field of animation, film scores quickly achieved a formidable virtuosity.  The Disney studio, founded in 1923, added a soundtrack to "Steamboat Willie" in 1928, promoted the hit song "Who's Afraid of the Big, Bad Wolf?" in "The Three Little Pigs" (1933) and thereafter specialized in comic shorts and full-length animated musicals, the first of which was "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937), with music by Frank Churchill. "Fantasia" (1940) comprised inventive and witty scenes cut to famous pieces of classical music conducted by Stokowski.  Eisenstein admired Disney's work for its close integration of image and music, and the term "mickey-mousing" (i.e. musical effects directly synchronized with, and illustrative of, specific actions on screen) was adopted in live-action cinema, where it had proved especially appropriate in slapstick comedy. At Warner Brothers, Carl Stalling composed for the Bugs Bunny series between 1936 and 1958, while at MGM in the same period Scott Bradley wrote witty, jazz-inflected music for the Tom and Jerry cartoons; his score to "The Cat that Hated People" (1947) used a 12-note row with its retrograde to represent the antics of cat and mouse, while "The Cat Concerto" of the same year was cunningly cut to an adaptation of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody no.2. Established Hollywood film composers who contributed to full-length animated features include Raksin ("The Unicorn in the Garden", 1953), Rosenman ("The Lord of the Rings", 1978) and Hans Zimmer ("The Lion King", 1993), while Disney's musicals have since 1989 been dominated by the work of Alan Menken.  The boom in television viewing in the 1950s threatened to diminish cinema audiences, who were lured into movie theatres by new gimmicks such as widescreen and 3-D presentation. Four-track stereophonic sound was introduced in the first CinemaScope production, "The Robe" (1953), with a score by Alfred Newman; alongside the greater flexibility of editing techniques made possible by the introduction of soundtrack recording on 35 mm magnetic tape in 1950, the increase in audio quality was significant. Lavish historical epics were ideal for the grandeur of widescreen presentation, and commanded budgets of which television companies could only dream. For these, Rózsa developed a manner of underscoring which drew heavily on organum techniques and quartal harmony to create a pseudo-archaic style, backed up by careful historical research, for the Roman epics "Quo vadis?" (1951), "Julius Caesar" (1953) and "Ben-Hur" (1959), and the Spanish epic "El Cid" (1961); composers influenced by this style included Alex North ("Spartacus", 1960; "Cleopatra", 1963).  Increasing competition from television, coupled with the demise of the permanent studio orchestras precipitated by a damaging musicians' union strike in 1958, made the survival of mainstream Hollywood scoring in the 1960s less than certain: commercially targeted youth audiences ensured that jazz (see §5), electronic scores (see §6) and pop music (see §7) came to dominate the market.  However, the success of full-blooded orchestral scores by composers such as Jerry Goldsmith ("The Blue Max", 1966; "The Omen", 1976; "Star Trek: the Motion Picture", 1979) and John Williams ("Jaws", 1975; "Star Wars", 1977; "Raiders of the Lost Ark", 1981; "E.T.", 1982) steadily steered film music back towards its traditional symphonic realm. A fluid balance between lyrical and dissonant orchestral scoring, jazz, electronics, popular song and non-Western or traditional music, and rock-tinged percussiveness prevails in the work of contemporary Hollywood composers such as Carter Burwell, Bill Conti, Randy Edelman, Cliff Eidelman, Danny Elfman, Elliot Goldenthal, Dave Grusin, James Horner, James Newton Howard, Mark Isham, Michael Kamen, Thomas Newman, Basil Poledouris, Graeme Revell, Marc Shaiman, Howard Shore, Alan Silvestri and Hans Zimmer. More exceptional have been the extended minimalist soundtracks supplied by Philip Glass for the non-narrative films "Koyaanisqatsi" (1983) and "Powaqqatsi" (1988), although his music for "The Secret Agent" (1996) revealed a grasp of more conventional expressive techniques.

Musicology, §II: Disciplines of musicology. II. Disciplines of musicology 2. Theoretical and analytical method. (iii) Analytic traditions.  It is useful to distinguish music analysis as a subdiscipline in music theory from the regulative traditions just described, even though the two are interdependent. While a fuller history and taxonomy of music analysis is recounted elsewhere (see Analysis), it will be appropriate here to say something about the methods and claims of music analysis and its relation to be broader epistemology of music theory.  In music analysis one is primarily concerned with the structure and individuating features of a particular piece of music. Typically, this involves two tasks: (1) to inventory the components of a particular composition deemed significant by the analyst; and (2) to explain the particular disposition and relationship of those components. Of course, any kind of analysis presupposes a theoretical stance: that is to say, it is not possible to undertake an analysis without theoretical presumptions, however informally conceived, that help determine the questions to pose and the kinds of language and method by which these questions may be answered. But unlike the systematic traditions of regulative theory described earlier, the goal of music analysis is normally an understanding and aesthetic appreciation of the musical piece itself as an ontologically unique artwork, not the exemplification of some broader norm of structure or syntax.  A good example of such particularist analysis is seen in E.T.A. Hoffmann's famous review of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, published in 1810. Unlike many earlier examples of music "analysis" that offered generalized taxonomies of particular pieces (often using rhetorical terminology) in order to illustrate classical norms of structure and process, Hoffman undertook his analysis to reveal what was distinguishing and unique in Beethoven's composition. For Hoffmann, much of this uniqueness stemmed from the music's particular motivic material and its ingenious development. Not surprisingly, such close analytic readings were indebted to Romantic ideologies of historicism and the cult of artistic genius; far from being models for compositional emulation, the musical objects of analysis tended to be drawn from a canon of irreproduceable "masterworks". Analysis revealed at once the singular features that made up a particular composition (these typically being unusual thematic and harmonic material or special deviations from formal conventions) as well as the means by which these features cohered as an organic whole, to cite a favourite metaphor of the 19th century. Of course, a more pragmatic tradition of analysis continued with the 19th-century pedagogical "Kompositionslehre". That is, musical pieces might be analysed for the purpose of learning and testing norms of chordal succession or form. But by the 20th century, with the loss of a common grammar of tonality and received forms of organizational structure, music analysis was increasingly becoming piece-orientated.  Heinrich Schenker occupies a particularly important place in 20th-century music analysis, not simply because his ideas have enjoyed such unparalleled influence - especially in Anglo-American academic circles - but because his work so clearly reflects the dialectic relation of music analysis and theoretical systematization. Originating through an intensive study of a select canon of tonal masterworks (especially Beethoven), Schenker's mature theory of the "Ursatz" and its "prolongation" through structural levels emerged only after many years of struggle and thought. Although presented as an "a priori" systems of tonal logic, Schenker's theory also receives empirical validation - and indeed, can only be known - through practice, albeit a practice that is highly selective and arguably self-confirming.  Schenker's theory presents itself as both a universal theory of tonality and a sophisticated tool of analysis by which an individual piece of tonal music may be opened up for inspection and its individuating features of harmony, form and thematic content delineated with unprecedented precision (see Schenker, heinrich).  At the close of the 20th century, music theory and analysis seemed finally to have matured as intellectual disciplines. Particularly in North America, although increasingly elsewhere, many academic programmes of music theory were established in universities and music conservatories alongside more traditional programmes of historical musicology. At the same time, numerous academic journals and professional societies devoted to music theory and analysis were founded, including the "Journal of Music Theory" (1957), "Musical Analysis" (1981) and "Musiktheorie" (1986), and the publications of the Society for Music Theory (from 1977).  It is ironic that just as music theory seems to have become institutionally accepted, strong criticisms have been voiced within those institutions concerning its conservative domain and scientistic aspirations (Kerman, 1985). Most compellingly, perhaps, many music theorists and analysts have been criticized for their penchant for considering musical pieces and styles largely from a formalistic, autonomous point of view rather than within broader historical and cultural contexts. At the same time, theorists have been faulted for too often disregarding questions of affect, expression or meaning in musical pieces at the expense of structural description.  It is true that in the course of the 20th century, much scholarship in music theory could be characterized as highly formalistic. Logical positivism, in particular, was an obvious influence on the work of many theorists such as Babbitt, who famously demanded that all analytic statements about music should adhere to strictly scientific criteria of formulation and verification (Babbitt, 1961, p.3). Other potent influences on music analysis (particularly in the 1960s) were developments in literary theory and specifically the movements of "New Criticism" and structuralism, by which texts were analysed as discrete and autonomous objects standing apart from questions of historical origin or authorial intention. Certainly, a number of music theorists in their analytic work have tested a formidable array of tools and models borrowed from neighbouring disciplines that on the surface suggest positivist and structuralist pedigree, including mathematical group theory (David Lewin), cognitive psychology (Leonard Meyer, Eugene Narmour), information theory (Kraehenbuhl and Coons), generative linguistics (Lehrdahl and Jackendoff), and semiotics (Jean-Jacques Nattiez, Kofi Agawu and Robert Hatten). Probably little of this research would stand the test of Babbitt's strict rules for theoretical formulation and verification. As in many other scholarly disciplines, the explicitly positivistic and structuralist aspirations of music theory in the 1960s and 70s have considerably receded.  If in reality music theory and analysis were ever as uniformally conservative and narrow in scope as their critics have implied, it was certainly not true at the close of the 20th century. The repertories of music considered by analysts expanded dramatically to include virtually all historical periods, as well as much non-Western music and popular or vernacular musics. At the same time, many theorists showed increased sensitivity to problems of historical and social context, affective content and reception in their analyses. In particular, interpretative and critical modes of analysis (whose origins may be traced back to late 19th-century traditions of "hermeneutic" analysis) are strongly evident in much recent musicological scholarship (Scott Burnham, Rose Subotnik, Brian Hyer), as are radically subjective "phenomenological" modes of analysis (Thomas Clifton, Benjamin Boretz, Marion Guck) and post-Freudian theories of compositional influence and repression (Joseph Straus, Kevin Korsyn). Even issues regarding gender and sexuality so dominant in much "postmodern" cultural criticism have been provocatively addressed by some recent musicologists (Susan McClary, Lawrence Kramer; see §II, below). Yet if music theory and analysis are to continue to retain identities as authentic intellectual traditions, it is perhaps desirable to maintain some degree of epistemological formalism and empirical rigour. Far from suggesting a weakness in the programme of music theory, a certain autonomy - and tension - in relation to historical musicology and cultural criticism may indeed be a healthy sign of its vitality and integrity.

Global Warming: It's All About Energy  Finally, after years of effort by dedicated scientists and activists like Al Gore, the issue of global warming has begun to receive the international attention it desperately needs. The publication on February 2 of the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), providing the most persuasive evidence to date of human responsibility for rising world temperatures, generated banner headlines around the world. But while there is a growing consensus on humanity’s responsibility for global warming, policymakers have yet to come to terms with its principal cause: our unrelenting consumption of fossil fuels.  When talk of global warming is introduced into the public discourse, as in Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth,” it is generally characterized as an environmental problem, akin to water pollution, air pollution, pesticide abuse, and so on. This implies that it can be addressed – like those other problems – through a concerted effort to “clean up” our resource-utilization behavior, by substituting “green” products for ordinary ones, by restricting the release of toxic substances, and so on.  But global warming is not an “environmental” problem in the same sense as these others – it is an energy problem, first and foremost. Almost 90% of the world’s energy is supplied through the combustion of fossil fuels, and every time we burn these fuels to make energy we release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; carbon dioxide, in turn, is the principal component of the “greenhouse gases” (GHGs) that are responsible for warming the planet. Energy use and climate change are two sides of the same coin. Fossil Fuel Dependency  Consider the situation in the United States. According to the Department of Energy (DoE), carbon dioxide emissions constitute 84% of this nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. Of all U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, most – 98% – are emitted as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels, which currently provide approximately 86% of America’s total energy supply. This means that energy use and carbon dioxide emissions are highly correlated: the more energy we consume, the more CO2 we release into the atmosphere, and the more we contribute to the buildup of GHGs.  Because Americans show no inclination to reduce their consumption of fossil fuels – but rather are using more and more of them all the time – one can foresee no future reduction in U.S. emissions of GHGs. According to the DoE, the United States is projected to consume 35% more oil, coal, and gas combined in 2030 than in 2004; not surprisingly, the nation’s emissions of carbon dioxide are expected to rise by approximately the same percentage over this period. If these projections prove accurate, total U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in 2030 will reach a staggering 8.1 billion metric tons, of which 42% will be generated through the consumption of oil (most of it in automobiles, vans, trucks, and buses), 40% by the burning of coal (principally to produce electricity), and the remainder by the combustion of natural gas (mainly for home heating and electricity generation). No other activity in the United States will come even close in terms of generating GHG emissions.  What is true of the United States is also true of other industrialized and industrializing nations, including China and India. Although a few may rely on nuclear power or energy renewables to a greater extent than the United States, all continue to consume fossil fuels and to emit large quantities of carbon dioxide, and so all are contributing to the acceleration of global climate change. According to the DoE, global emissions of carbon dioxide are projected to increase by a frightening 75% between 2003 and 2030, from 25.0 to 43.7 billion metric tons. People may talk about slowing the rate of climate change, but if these figures prove accurate, the climate will be much hotter in coming decades and this will produce the most damaging effects predicted by the IPCC.  What this tells us is that the global warming problem cannot be separated from the energy problem. If the human community continues to consume more fossil fuels to generate more energy, it inevitably will increase the emission of carbon dioxide and so hasten the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, thus causing irreversible climate change. Whatever we do on the margins to ameliorate this process – such as planting trees to absorb some of the carbon emissions or slowing the rate of deforestation – will have only negligible effect so long as the central problem of fossil-fuel consumption is left unchecked. State of Denial  Many political and business leaders wish to deny this fundamental reality. They may claim to accept the conclusions of the IPCC report. They will admit that vigorous action is needed to stem the buildup of greenhouse gases. But they will nevertheless seek to shield energy policy from fundamental change.  Typical of this approach is a talk given by Rex W. Tillerson, the CEO of Exxon Mobil, at a conference organized by Cambridge Energy Research Associates on February 13. As head of the world’s largest publicly traded energy firm, Tillerson receives special attention when he talks. That his predecessor Lee Raymond often disparaged the science of global warming lent his comments particular significance. Yes, Tillerson admitted, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were increasing, and this contributed to the planet’s gradual warming. But then, in language characteristic of the industry, he added, “The scale advantages of oil and natural gas across a broad array applications provide economic value unmatched by any alternative.” It would therefore be a terrible mistake, he added, to rush into the development of energy alternatives when the consequences of global warming are still not fully understood.  The logic of this mode of thinking is inescapable. The continued production of fossil fuels to sustain our existing economic system is too important to allow the health of the planet to stand in its way. Buy into this mode of thought, and you can say goodbye to any hope of slowing – let alone reversing – the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. What to Do  If, however, we seek to protect the climate while there is still time to do so, we must embrace a fundamental transformation in our energy behavior: nothing else will make a significant difference. In practice, this devolves into two fundamental postulates. We must substantially reduce our consumption of fossil fuels, and we must find ways to capture and bury the carbon by-products of the fossil fuels we do consume.  Various strategies have been proposed to achieve these objectives. Those that offer significant promise should be utilized to the maximum extent possible. This is not the place to evaluate these strategies in detail, except to make a few broad comments.  First, as noted, since 42% of American carbon dioxide emissions (the largest share) are produced through the combustion of petroleum, anything that reduces oil consumption – higher fuel-efficiency standards for motor vehicles, bigger incentives for hybrids, greater use of ethanol, improved public transportation, car-pooling, and so – should be made a major priority.  Second, because the combustion of coal in electrical power plants is our next biggest source of CO2, improving the efficiency of these plants and filtering out the harmful emissions has to be another top priority.  Finally, we should accelerate research into promising new techniques for the capture and “sequestration” of carbon during the combustion of fossil fuels in electricity generation. Some of these plans call for burying excess carbon in hollowed-out coalmines and oil wells – a very practical use for these abandoned relics, but only if it can be demonstrated that none of the carbon will leak back into the atmosphere, adding to the buildup of GHGs.  Global warming is an energy problem, and we cannot have both an increase in conventional fossil fuel use and a habitable planet. It’s one or the other. We must devise a future energy path that will meet our basic (not profligate) energy needs and also rescue the climate while there’s still time. The technology to do so is potentially available to us, but only if we make the decision to develop it swiftly and on a very large scale.

Latin America: Climate Change Swing States  U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern traveled with Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo Valenzuela to Chile, Peru, and Ecuador last week, to discuss climate change with his government counterparts and civil society. Deepening bilateral and multilateral cooperation to increase economic growth, cutting greenhouse gasses, and helping climate-vulnerable populations were on the official program.  But the political objective of the trip was to push the Copenhagen Accord — a controversial agreement the United States introduced to UN climate talks in 2009 and that several Latin American countries blocked — in advance of the climate summit in Mexico at the end of 2010.  Stern's South American tour — only three weeks before the next UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiating session in Bonn — shows the increasingly important role of Latin American nations in reaching a climate deal. His itinerary offered a window into how the United States is using the climate debate as part of a larger agenda to secure political influence, trade, and access to resources in the hemisphere. An Emerging Latin America  Wealthy countries ("Annex 1" in UNFCCC-speak) have long been at the center of the climate change negotiations. Together, these countries secure their power by probing at the fault lines that already exist between developing countries — often pitting the most impoverished nations against economically emerging ones. And Annex 1 countries repeatedly pass the buck to developing countries for the failure of negotiations, often blaming China, the Philippines, or any other country that refuses to go along with provisions that will fundamentally undermine developing countries' economic and ecological interests.  Developing countries in the G77+China (a negotiating block that represents more than 130 nations) have been flexing their collective muscle in climate negotiations of late, especially around the right to develop. China and India, both major emitters of greenhouse gases, are considered influential players because any plan to reduce emissions without their participation would not stop climate chaos. Small island states and African nations hold moral authority, because climate change will be most devastating to their peoples. Latin America, meanwhile, has never been at the center of the climate debate — until now.  This year, global climate negotiations will be held in Cancun, Mexico. The Mexican government is under intense pressure to avoid a repeat of the fiasco in Copenhagen. At that time, the Danish hosts floundered in procedural upheaval, left delegates shivering outside the convention hall while demonstrations erupted inside, and ultimately couldn't corral the assembled countries into adopting a comprehensive decision.  The Mexican government is determined to make substantial progress on at least two key elements: climate finance and the use of carbon markets to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). At the same time, it's implicitly cautioning that prospects for a global climate deal don't look promising. Christina Figueres, the 15-year veteran of the Costa Rican negotiating team tapped as the new secretary of the UNFCCC, will be responsible for ensuring that negotiations don't run aground.  Brazil, largest of the nine countries that make up the Amazon Basin, has positioned itself as a leader on REDD in the Americas. With millions of hectares of land and potentially trillions of dollars at stake — not to mention the rights of indigenous peoples and state sovereignty — Brazil is a key player.  In addition, Bolivia has emerged, along with Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, as a bastion for climate justice. Enraged by the exclusive process that led to the Copenhagen Accord, Bolivia called a summit of its own, inviting all governments and civil society to a World Peoples Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth in Cochabamba this April. One outcome of the global gathering was a Peoples Agreement that Bolivia officially submitted to the UNFCCC on behalf of global civil society. Disappointingly, the official text didn't reflect anything from this agreement. But Bolivia succeeded in generating critical mass for much of its content, including respect for indigenous peoples' rights; rejection of carbon offsetting; immediate and deep reductions in greenhouse gasses from industrialized countries; and the massive transfer of financial resources from developed to developing nations. The U.S. Agenda  The United States clearly spelled out its agenda for the international climate negotiations in the strategic communications objectives accidentally leaked in April. At the top of the list was "reinforc[ing] the perception that the U.S. is constructively engaged in UN negotiations in an effort to produce a global regime to combat climate change." The document also compels the U.S. negotiating team to "create a clear understanding of the CA's [Copenhagen Accord's] standing and the importance of operationalizing ALL elements."  The Copenhagen Accord embodies all of the major political demands of the United States. Binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have been scaled back to a voluntary "pledge and review" process. The pledges made so far fall short of the 25-40 percent cuts by rich countries that scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say are necessary to avoid climate catastrophe. Missing those targets carries no legal consequences.  Also gone is the distinction between countries that released the vast majority of global warming gases throughout history and those that have recently joined the ranks of the largest emitters. The Copenhagen Accord requires all developing countries — except small island nations and least-developed countries — to implement greenhouse gas mitigation actions. In fact, the Accord actually stipulates more stringent transparency and reporting requirements for those nations than for wealthy countries.  Developing countries predictably opposed the notion that they should take on binding emissions cuts before the most wealthy and largest emitters on the planet. They also note that the impact of symmetrical cuts is very different for people living in richer and poorer nations. For example, a 20 percent cut in U.S. rates would mean an average reduction to 16 tons of carbon per year per person. The same cut in India would move the average carbon footprint from 1.6 tons to 1.3 tons per year. In other words, even a modest cut in affluent countries would do little to change people's quality of life, but it would lock developing countries in poverty.  The Copenhagen Accord extols market incentives to bring REDD and forest carbon trading online. REDD is critical to the U.S. pledge to cut emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. Purchasing forest carbon credits is cheaper, faster, and easier than cleaning up polluting factories and power plants. Instead of reducing emissions in the United States, polluters would pay forested countries to keep their trees standing, thus "buying" the carbon in the trees to offset their continued release of greenhouse gasses at home. But offsets in general, and forest offsets in particular, have met resistance from climate scientists, financiers, and local communities because they are difficult to verify and impinge on traditional uses of and rights to forests.  In addition, the accord outlines parameters for climate finance. It promises that developed countries will mobilize up to $30 billion by 2012 and $100 billion a year by 2020 for developing countries to adapt to climate change and move to low-carbon development pathways.  Countries like Bolivia and Ecuador argue that rich countries instead owe the developing world a "climate debt." The Annex 1 countries should repay this debt, in part, by drastically reducing emissions to make room for the people of non-Annex 1 countries to use their fair share of the planet's atmosphere. Because the industrialized world is in such arrears, climate justice proponents believe that there is no room for offsetting any carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits. Instead, they demand wealthy countries cover communities' costs for adapting to a warming world, and make good on commitments enshrined in the UNFCCC to provide support for the transition to low-carbon development. The $100 billion per year outlined in the accord, according to data from the UNDP, UNFCCC, and World Bank, is wholly inadequate to meet these needs.  At his first two stops in Chile and Peru last week, Stern obliquely scolded Copenhagen Accord detractors, saying that "asserting positions that others can't accept will not advance the ball." Yet when the United States asserts positions that conflict with developing country interests, less powerful nations are expected to fall in line or fall out of favor.  To add weight to its warning that countries cannot "cherry pick" the pieces of the accord they like, the United States cut $3 million in climate finance to Bolivia and $2.5 million to Ecuador. Stern stated that the funding was "agreed to as part of the Copenhagen Accord, and as a general matter, the United States is going to use its funds to go to countries that have indicated an interest to be part of the Accord."  The new U.S. "paradigm for climate diplomacy" introduced by climate negotiators in June would seem to include blackmailing developing countries that desperately need support to deal with the consequences of a crisis they did not create. Stern Goes South  Also in the leaked strategic communications objectives was a proposal to "consider a series of policy speeches/public forums during trips abroad to make our case directly to the developing world." Cue Todd Stern.  The first stop on Stern's tour was Chile — a country that, with Colombia, worked to convince Bolivia and other developing countries to support the accord. In his address to students and faculty, assembled at the University of Chile's School of Economics and Business, Stern congratulated Chile for supporting the Copenhagen Accord. He highlighted the need for greater regional coordination and called on the Americas to install more clean energy to "widen the circle of prosperity across our hemisphere and also reduce our carbon emissions."  What Stern didn't mention is that Chile, as one of the global leaders in hydropower, is generating millions of carbon credits that developed countries would want if commitments to reduce emissions are made in Cancun or the year after. The United States already has established close economic ties with Chile in the free-trade agreement the two countries signed in 2004, and plans to fully liberalize trade by 2016 are underway. Energy and abundant carbon credits may well be two commodities that the United States will be shopping for by then.  Peru, a country that's had a free trade agreement with the United States since early 2009, may also be an important source of cheap carbon credits, in much the same way it now makes minerals and metals readily available to corporations up north. According to Jose Alberto Garibaldi, a former member of Mexico's UNFCCC negotiating team, Peru has been maneuvering behind the scenes to find an agreement on reducing emissions from deforestation. Peru has not been a major player in climate negotiations. But Stern remarked in Lima that through the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion and Environmental Cooperation Agreement, "Peru has signaled a commitment to work closely with the U.S. to set up forest and environment management systems…while generating broad-based economic benefits from its forests." He told Peruvians assembled there that the United States welcomes "exploring possibilities for collaboration with you and your neighbors on an Amazon REDD program." Stern's visit may be a subtle nod of approval for their role in securing a forest carbon market and a precursor to pressure from Washington on Peru to build regional support for the Copenhagen Accord.  Perhaps most surprising was Stern's stop in Quito, Ecuador. The United States slashed $2.5 million of support when Ecuador submitted a letter that it would not join the accord. In response, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patiño offered the United States $2.5 million if Obama signed the Kyoto Protocol. During his visit Stern diplomatically said that the United States and Ecuador "have to be willing to listen to each other and talk to each other and exchange views." But he rejected the idea of paying back climate debt out of hand, saying "historic debt or guilt or culpability, no. I don't see it that way."  Will Stern attempt to repair the relationship with the United States, knowing that support from Ecuador — an Amazon Basin country with a legacy of indigenous struggle for land rights — will improve the chances for a deal on REDD? Does he sense a fissure between Ecuador and Bolivia that could be exploited to pacify Latin American opposition to the Copenhagen Accord? The New Land Grab  In a carbon-constrained world, atmospheric space and the right to pollute translate into big bucks. If a multilateral cap-and-trade scheme like the Kyoto Protocol is put into place globally, the right to emit a ton of carbon could be worth anywhere between $2 and $85. The result will be a trillion-dollar international carbon market. Then there are implications for securing energy from low-carbon sources like hydropower, minerals needed for new technologies like efficient batteries, and land on which to grow palm oil, biomass, and carbon-sequestering forests.  No one knows this better than Todd Stern. At the National Agrarian University in Peru, he noted that "less-developed countries around the world that may find themselves resource-poor right now — in a global energy system based on fossil-fuels — have the potential to become resource rich when the sun, wind, and earth are harnessed to create the energy foundation of the 21st century." He stated that "there is already a race on to create and capture the new markets of the clean energy 21st century."  The climate community and political pundits will be spending a long time interpreting the signals from this visit, and from future meetings Stern and other U.S. climate officials have with foreign countries. This climate change debate is about much more than ecological stability. Global climate treaties will determine which countries' fossil-fuel-based growth will be constrained and by how much. The resulting international agreements and domestic policies will determine the relative importance of natural resources in the global economy. Because minerals, forests, agricultural soils, and water are not spread evenly across the planet, securing access to these and other resources will be — and in many regions already are — at the center of the geopolitical struggle precipitated by climate change.

Ozone Depletion &amp; Global Warming   Key Points      The U.S. is spending billions of dollars each year to combat the effects of ozone depletion and global warming on human health and weather patterns.     Two groundbreaking international treaties, the Montreal and Kyoto protocols, have failed to adequately curb use of the chemicals causing ozone depletion and global warming.     Ozone depletion and global warming are both man-made and interconnected, and they constitute the most serious environmental crises ever.  People in the United States now spend over $3 billion annually to correct eye cataracts that can result from exposure to ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation. The insurance industry is spending tens of billions of dollars to help people whose lives have been disrupted by unusual weather events spawned by global climate change. These facts alone should spur U.S. environmental negotiators to take actions that reduce and eliminate the production, use, and emissions of both ozone depleting and global warming chemicals as soon as technologically feasible.  Industry’s long-term reliance on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), methyl bromide, and other chemicals is resulting in a global atmospheric crisis that cannot be ignored. Normally, the ozone layer blocks nearly all UV-B radiation, which plays a significant role in the formation of skin cancers, eye cataracts, immune system deficiencies, and other health maladies. A 1% loss of stratospheric ozone equals a 2% increase in skin cancers and a nearly 1% increase in eye cataracts worldwide. These are just a few of the reasons why world leaders formulated the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting Substances, designed to quickly eliminate the use of CFCs and other ozone depleting chemicals.  Ratified by 172 countries and hailed by many experts as the most successful international environmental agreement, the Montreal Protocol has, unfortunately, not succeeded in halting deterioration of the ozone layer. In 1998 and 1999, the Antarctic ozone hole was found to be the largest, deepest, and longest lasting ever. Increased ground-level UV-B radiation has been reported in many parts of the world, including New Zealand and Canada.  Further, in late 1997 and again in late 1999, the European Space Agency reported evidence of an ozone hole over Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia. These events were a result of unusually low temperatures in the stratosphere, increasing the rate of ozone depletion caused by ozone consuming chemicals. Consequently, it appears that ozone losses may be more severe than scientists originally anticipated. This news has motivated the European Community to become the most vocal proponent of further actions to protect the ozone layer.  There is also evidence that ozone depletion is masking global warming, because ozone depletion cools the stratosphere even though the earth’s surface temperatures are higher than historic averages. Global warming is predicted to cause rising ocean levels, lower plant productivity, and more frequent and dangerous weather patterns. Ozone depletion may also make it harder to combat global warming, because more UV light penetrates the world’s oceans and destroys plankton. Plankton plays a pivotal role in the ability of oceans to draw carbon dioxide (the primary global warming chemical) from the atmosphere, thereby making oceans (along with rainforests) important “carbon sinks.” Loss of these “sinks” further exacerbates global warming by accelerating the buildup of so-called greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Two sets of international agreements seek to address these crises: the Vienna Convention and its 1987 Montreal Protocol for ozone depletion and, for global warming, the Framework Convention on Climate Change and its 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a highly complex treaty signed by over 175 countries. Although the Montreal Protocol does phase out the worst ozone depleting substances (CFCs, HCFCs, halons, methyl bromide), unfortunately it allows ozone depleting chemicals to be replaced with two greenhouse gases, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Both of these chemicals are among the six global warming gases to be controlled under the Kyoto Protocol.  The Montreal and Kyoto protocols contain mechanisms for reviewing the scientific knowledge, revising control target dates, and banning more chemicals. The Montreal Protocol’s Scientific Assessments (1989, 1991, 1994, and 1998) have led, for instance, to the adoption of three amendments to create phase-out schedules for methyl bromide, HCFCs, and other ozone depleting chemicals. The much newer Kyoto Protocol, although not amended to date, has a similar mechanism requiring a scientific review of its provisions.  As we enter the new millennium, the scientific evidence is overwhelming that global warming and ozone depletion are two of the most serious environmental crises ever faced by humankind. Because they are interlinked, there is an urgent need for new strategies that will combat them simultaneously.    Problems with Current U.S. Policy Key Problems      U.S. agencies responsible for implementing the Montreal Protocol are working at cross-purposes, leading to weak efforts to protect the ozone layer.     Washington has failed to support efforts to accelerate the HCFC phaseout.     The U.S. has not sufficiently supported the adoption of alternatives to ozone depleting and climate changing substances like HCFCs.  U.S. treatment of the Montreal and Kyoto protocols as mutually exclusive environmental treaties not only fails to internalize the new scientific evidence demonstrating the correlation between ozone depletion and global warming but also leads to ineffective, discordant policymaking that does not adequately protect life on earth against these synergistic atmospheric threats. In addition, the Clinton administration has accommodated industry interests bent on prolonging the use of ozone depleting and global warming chemicals. Washington, for instance, has refused to accelerate the HCFC phaseout or to close a loophole that allows methyl bromide (MB) use in developing countries even after 2005, when it is phased out in developed countries.  In 1992, the Montreal Protocol allowed continued use of MB—a deadly pesticide as well as a potent ozone depleter—for fumigation of goods and shipping containers used in international and domestic trade. This use currently accounts for over 22% of the MB consumed worldwide. U.S. agencies are split on the MB question. Under pressure from industry lobbyists, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has expanded MB application to include wood products used in international shipping from China and Mexico, even though both countries have indicated that heat treatment is both less expensive and less environmentally harmful. An August 1999 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) memo also stated that the agency “cannot find the rationale” for wood importers to use MB.  U.S. policymaking has been inconsistent in other ways as well. The Montreal Protocol temporarily exempts the production and use of CFCs for medical purposes. Several European and some developing countries have taken action, mindful of balancing medical needs with environmental needs, to shift away from metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) containing CFCs. The EPA concurs with this position. However, in September 1999, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated it would not end approvals of new CFC MDIs, even though one non-CFC MDI has been approved and more are on the way. At the 1999 meeting of the Montreal Protocol in Beijing, the U.S. helped block a proposal by Costa Rica that would have further controlled these uses and facilitated a more effective transition from CFC MDIs to alternative medicine-delivery methods.  Under the Montreal Protocol, HCFCs will not be phased out until 2030. The European Commission (EC) and many nongovernmental organizations have advocated for an accelerated HCFC phaseout. However, the U.S. has not supported these efforts, primarily because DuPont and other U.S. companies have spent billions of dollars on developing HCFCs as alternatives to CFCs. Only in 1999 did the Clinton administration finally agree to new controls on the production of HCFCs, but it still failed to accelerate the consumption phase-out schedule. Though the agreement signals progress in U.S. policymaking, Washington’s position on HCFC phaseout is still unclear.  Adding to the dangers of a slow HCFC phaseout, use of other fluorocarbon-based chemicals—HFCs and PFCs—is also being permitted. These chemicals are among the six gases designated for control under the Global Climate Change Convention. This incongruity has led to confusion about the best alternative to adopt in both developed and developing countries. Failure to control HFCs and PFCs further reduces the incentive for industry to pursue alternatives to ozone depleting and global warming substances.  The fluorocarbon industry, represented by the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy, continues to aggressively promote HFCs and HCFCs for use in developing countries. Alliance lobbyists at the annual international ozone meetings target developing countries, arguing that these chemicals cannot be phased out because commercially viable alternatives are not available. In fact, there are now only a few cases where there are no alternatives, and in some of these situations, the protocol permits companies to request permission to use these chemicals under emergency provisions.  To date, the U.S. has not adequately supported the adoption of non-ozone depleting alternatives at the international level and has not sufficiently promoted low global warming and non-HCFC technologies under its own CFC alternatives policy called the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP). The EPA created SNAP to facilitate the adoption of alternatives to CFCs and halons, and its mandate is to publish lists of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes. To make the determination of what is acceptable, the agency relies on information supplied by staff scientists, consultants, science advisors, the public, and corporations. In practice, the EPA has frequently recommended the industry proposal of substituting HCFCs and HFCs for CFCs in the refrigeration, air conditioning, and insulating foam sectors, even when non-ozone depleting, non-global warming alternatives are available.       Toward a New Foreign Policy Key Recommendations      The U.S. should legally link the two agreements to ensure that the implementation of the Montreal Protocol doesn’t undermine the Kyoto Protocol.     The U.S. should work to phase out HCFCs by 2004.     The U.S. should increase the amount of funding it provides to the Multilateral Fund by designating a portion of the existing ozone depleting chemical tax to the fund.  Protection of the ozone layer was one of the hottest environmental issues during the 1992 presidential race. Considering the new scientific evidence showing the negative synergies between global climate change and ozone depletion, these twin crises should be playing a major role in the environmental positions of candidates in the 2000 campaigns.  The next president will be in a unique position to change existing policies to make them more consistent with the clear need to stop the spiraling damage to the earth’s atmosphere. Regardless of the composition of the next Congress, the president has the executive authority to enact a number of necessary reforms. For example, the new president could require the EPA and the USDA to ban all use of methyl bromide in shipping, except in emergencies. Furthermore, the president could distinguish himself by committing to work with Congress to increase the funding portion that the U.S. contributes to the Multilateral Fund. Such leadership could encourage other countries to take similar actions.  The U.S. needs to ensure that the goals of the Montreal Protocol do not undermine the Kyoto Protocol. To do so, it should support the legal linkage between the two protocols and should ban the adoption of HCFCs, HFCs, and other global warming chemicals as alternatives to ozone depleting chemicals, unless there is no other technologically feasible alternative.  The Montreal Protocol is already linked with the Basel Convention on the International Transport of Hazardous Wastes. In 1995, the parties to the Basel Convention agreed to ban the trade of ozone depleting substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol. The parties to the Montreal Protocol should take a similar decision to ensure that technologies adopted as alternatives to ozone depleting substances do not undermine the goals of the Kyoto Protocol.  The Montreal Protocol’s current phaseout of 2030 for HCFCs is too distant to curb either ozone layer destruction or global warming. An accelerated phaseout would compel the chemical industry to innovate as it did when it developed HCFCs as an alternative to CFCs.  HCFCs should be phased out no later than 2004. According to the 1998 scientific assessment, eliminating HCFC production is the third most important action that the parties can take to accelerate the recovery of the ozone layer. (Assuming full compliance with all of the phase-out requirements to date, the first and second most important actions would be to eliminate both Halon-1211 and Halon-1301 emissions worldwide by the end of this year.) A 2004 phaseout of HCFCs would also send a clear signal to developing countries not to use interim technologies when seeking CFC alternatives. Instead, they should be adopting longer-term solutions that protect the ozone layer and mitigate global warming. The existing 2030 phaseout does little to guide industry into the investments needed for research and development to make existing non-fluorocarbon-based alternatives more affordable.  In addition, the EPA should, as part of SNAP, support the emergence in the U.S. of non-ozone depleting alternatives, such as water foam blowing techniques and hydrocarbon and ammonia refrigerants. The EPA should also provide small grants to companies wishing to adopt the most appropriate technology and should track new product performance to inform future policy and negotiating positions. As Washington gains more experience with these alternatives, it will be in a better position to advocate for them at the international level.  The U.S. could also increase its financial commitment to the Multilateral Fund, which helps developing countries find nondestructive alternatives. Currently the U.S. provides about 24% of the total budget of the fund. Although this is the largest share contributed by any country, it is only fair, since U.S.-based companies manufacture the majority of ozone depleting chemicals. The U.S. could increase its share to the fund by earmarking a portion of its ozone depleting chemical tax. In addition, Washington should urge other countries to pay their commitments on time and in full. Japan, for instance, has committed to pay just under 20% but has never paid this amount in full. Italy, Germany, and other countries have also failed to meet their commitments.  Instead of looking back at the successful CFC phaseout, the U.S. needs to be looking toward the future and working to rapidly phase out all ozone depleting substances without compromising the goals of other treaties. This global atmospheric crisis is man-made and is not insurmountable. Through a combination of scientific know-how, industry innovation, political will, and sound public policy, the U.S. can help protect the ozone layer without adding to global warming.

Preventing a Blowout in the Arctic  By Julia Heath, February 15, 2012  arctic-drilling-russiaIn September 2011, Vladimir Putin announced a program to begin offshore oil and gas exploration and drilling in the Russian Arctic. Putin is also interested in creating new sea terminals, which he said would rival the Suez and Panama Canals. In 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil and 30 percent of the world’s undiscovered gas lay beneath the Arctic Seas. The United States, Canada, Norway, Greenland, and Russia, which make up the Arctic 5, are each interested in tapping these Arctic energy reserves.  Russia, the largest oil producer of the five, gets nearly half of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from oil exports, a level comparable to Saudi Arabia. As a result, Putin perceives fossil fuels as vital to Russia’s economy and political stability. However, the extreme Arctic climate, characterized by unpredictable weather patterns, heaving sea ice, sub-zero temperatures, dense fog, and darkness half the year, requires specialized equipment. Russia holds a technological advantage over the other Arctic countries because it has already invested in 20 icebreakers, while Canada has 12 and the United States only one. Russia signed a deal with British Petroleum last month to explore the Arctic. Therefore, Russia is currently leading the extractive assault.  ”The Gulf of Mexico is perhaps the most well-equipped region on the planet to deal with a massive oil spill,” says Lisa Speer of the National Resource Defense Council (NRDC), “and we had a really hard time dealing with that.” British Petroleum (BP) is one of the companies interested in drilling in Russia, along with Exxon Mobile and the Norwegian-owned Statoil. In 2010, BP proved woefully unprepared to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Unlike the Gulf, the Arctic region lacks basic infrastructure needed for spill response. For example, much of northern Russia, Canada, and Greenland lacks roads or airports, and there are only limited communications facilities. In Alaska, the nearest Coast Guard station is nearly 1,000 miles away. The lack of safety infrastructure combined with the extreme weather conditions is a red flag that BP—or any other oil company—is not prepared for Arctic oil extraction at this time. Arctic drilling is perilous for both employees and the environment.  Impact of Global Warming  Summer polar ice is projected to thaw completely by 2030. Entrepreneurs see this as an asset to be developed for trade and tourism. In 2011, America’s National Snow and Ice Data Center showed that ice covered 1.67 million square miles of the Arctic Ocean, with about half typically melting in the summer. However, in the past five years, the Arctic has lost up to two-thirds of its sea ice every summer. The more ice that melts, the greater the Arctic Ocean warms because the light-colored icecaps reflect warmth from the sun while the dark-colored ocean absorbs it. According to the UN Environment Program, soot from incomplete combustion, crop burning, forest fires, wood stoves, and diesel engines -— “black carbon” — also absorbs heat and is often washed into icecaps through rain or snow. An oil spill would darken sea ice and increase its capacity to absorb heat and hasten melting, as would increased pollution from the CO2-intensive development of Arctic infrastructure such as roads, platforms, tankers, ports, and pipelines. Additionally, as the tundra thaws and shrubbery and other darkly colored plants gradually migrate northward, they will also increase heat absorption in the Arctic. The thawing tundra makes developing roads, airports, bridges, pipelines, and other necessary infrastructure extremely unstable, adversely affecting poorly maintained pipelines as well as new infrastructure.  An unprecedented number of polar bears have drowned because of dwindling summer sea ice. Narwhal, walrus, and both bowhead and beluga whales, in addition to many kinds of seals and birds, will also continue to suffer from both Arctic warming and pollution. As climate change transforms the Arctic, species from warmer waters will move northward and further change the ecosystem. The killer whale, which feeds on narwhal, walrus, seal, and beluga and bowhead whales, has been increasing the duration of its Arctic visits. Other animals from warmer waters are endangering the habitat and food supply of native species. Arctic drilling would exacerbate this already serious problem.  Moreover, drilling produces toxic waste that requires proper disposal. Arctic species that already suffer from global concentrations of pollutants are sensitive to changes in climate and are relatively slow to adapt. Arctic development, increased pollution, and the possibility of toxic waste and oil spills — in addition to a current lack of adequate response mechanisms — put Arctic wildlife and those who depend on it at risk.  Indigenous peoples who have traditionally relied on the provisions of the Arctic include the Inuit in the United States, Canada, Greenland, and Russia, the Sami in Norway, and the Nenets in Russia. The Siberian Nenets have traditionally practiced reindeer herding, hunting, and fishing. Over half of Russia’s oil comes from West Siberia. The Nenets have criticized roadwork and bridge building in the area for blocking rivers that then flood and destroy pastureland and hinder reindeer and fish migration. Reindeer can hurt their hooves on glass or sharp metal left from industrial development, causing fatal infections. The Sami reindeer herders of Norway have corroborated that melting and development result in reduced reindeer populations. Development will continue to increase pressure on the traditional livelihoods of the Nenets and other native peoples as the quest for black gold ravages the Arctic Circle.  The Russian Record  Russia has had a terrible environmental record and a history of oil spills. The area around Usinsk, just south of the Arctic Circle, is home to what the Huffington Post calls “the world’s worst ecological oil catastrophe,” where leaks in a decommissioned oil well wreaked havoc in 2011.  It wasn't the first such incident. In 1994, the town suffered the third largest oil spill in history. A pipeline in Usinsk had been leaking for eight months when the dike containing the leakage collapsed, spreading 102,000 tons of oil across the tundra, into the Kolva and Rechora rivers, and eventually into the Barents Sea. The leak, eight times larger than the Exxon Valdez spill, was the result of old, corroded, poorly maintained, and over-pumped pipelines. The company responsible, Komineft, had five major accidents in the area between 1986 and 1994. In 1994, Russia was losing an estimated 20 percent of the oil it extracted, but refused to revamp inefficient and environmentally detrimental Soviet pipelines for fear that the break in production would lessen the Russian hold on former Soviet republics and interfere with loan repayment. More recently, Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund, and the Institute of the Environment and Genetics of Microorganisms have estimated that Russia continues to spill 5 million tons of oil every year, or as the Huffington Post put it, “one Deepwater Horizon-scale leak about every two months.”   Vladimir Chuprov, head of the Arctic campaign for Greenpeace Russia, said that Greenpeace International is absolutely against all offshore drilling in the Arctic. Even the U.S. Minerals Management Service estimates a one in five chance of a major spill occurring over the life of just one lease block on Alaska’s outer continental shelf (OCS). Greenpeace International wants to accord the Arctic a world park status similar to Antarctica. At the very least, they demand that the international community provide strict standards to eradicate the risk of oil spills and require mandatory guarantees that any spills will be mitigated at a cost no less than what was spent on the Deepwater Horizon spill.  Like Greenpeace International, the NRDC also advocates mandatory international standards on how to develop the Arctic. According to Lisa Speer of the NRDC, the United States doesn’t  “have enough information to be able to determine whether or not oil and gas activities can be conducted safely (in the Arctic). And we don’t have the ability to contain and clean up oil in ice, and therefore we think we should wait for drilling in the Arctic until we do have the ability to deal with that.”  At a forum on Arctic drilling in January 2012, Andrew Hartsig of the Ocean Conservancy recommended that the United States wait until it has a better hold on the technological requirements of Arctic drilling. However, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy (BOEM) representative Shoshana Lew replied that the federal five-year leasing plan for blocks on Alaska’s OCS would not be deferred until exploration was complete.  Putin abolished the Russian Environmental Agency in order to more easily access Arctic extraction that would otherwise require environmental assessments. This is particularly disconcerting because the Arctic region, according to the UN Environment Programme, “is characterized by some of the largest continuous intact ecosystems on the planet,” and therefore environmentally detrimental projects in the region should require careful consideration and planning.  The United States has been slow to invest in developing its own Arctic energy reserves for fear of ecological devastation. However, it has not done enough to slow development in nearby Russia. Russian offshore drilling is a crucial issue for Americans because polar currents could make an Arctic oil spill into a transnational event. A Russian Arctic oil spill would rapidly become a cultural, ecological, and economic disaster for the United States as well.  Avoiding a Spill  In 2009, the Arctic Council — which consists of eight Arctic states and six international organizations representing indigenous people in the region — recommended that the Arctic states cooperate and pool resources regarding environmental and search-and-rescue response resources and technology, infrastructure creation for navigation in addition to charts and communications, shipbuilding standards, and guidelines on oil and gas exploration. However, Lisa Speer criticizes the Arctic Council for focusing more on containment and response than on prevention. Speer thinks the Council must identify the most sensitive species and ecosystems to determine areas where drilling will have the least ecological impact.  Russia must focus on pipeline efficiency before investing in the Arctic. Greenpeace’s Chuprov says that offshore oil stocks in Russia are a myth. For example, Russia produced approximately 500 million tons of oil in 2010. By 2020, the Russian OCS is only expected to contribute 10 million tons of oil, only twice the amount that Russia loses each year in degraded pipeline spills. The Gazprom manager even claimed, “investment in the development of new fields and energy efficiency are competing with each other.”  The Russian Federation must focus regulations and state investments in efficiency before it invests more heavily in extremely risky Arctic offshore drilling and the technologies that it requires. The United States should make a greater effort to play a lead role in creating an international framework on Arctic development with a focus on spill prevention as well as spill response, cleanup, and restoration. Furthermore, it should continue to strictly regulate offshore drilling in the Alaskan OCS and increase domestic safety and environmental regulations in response to the Deepwater Horizon event. The prospect of a massive spill in the Arctic demands immediate action.

AIDS Appointee Shows that Business Still Rules the Roost. By Jim Lobe, July 3, 2003  The appointment of a former top executive of a major U.S. pharmaceutical company and major Republican contributor as President George W. Bush's global AIDS co-ordinator has stunned and outraged AIDS experts and activists. Bush's choice of former Eli Lilly &amp; Co. boss Randall Tobias was announced at the White House on July 1, just a few days before Bush's first trip as president to Africa. The U.S. Senate must confirm the nomination.  Tobias, who retired from Lilly in 1998 and more recently has served as vice chairman of AT&amp;T, where he also worked before going to Lilly in the early 1990s, is supposed to receive the rank of ambassador and report to Secretary of State Colin Powell, a major force behind a five-year, 15-billion-dollar anti-AIDS initiative--called the "Emergency Program"--first proposed by Bush last January and approved by Congress in a somewhat amended form in May.  Implementation of that initiative, which is targeted at 12 sub-Saharan African and two Caribbean countries, will be Tobias' first responsibility, according to Bush. "Randy Tobias has a mandate directly from me to get our AIDS initiative up and running as soon as possible," he said.     Surreal Appointment  Prof. Jeffrey Sachs, head of Columbia University's Earth Institute and a special adviser to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on the AIDS crisis, called the appointment "surreal" and continued that "This is an emergency that requires someone who's worked in the field and knows it thoroughly. We don't need someone who raises all sorts of questions about commitment and agenda."  Advocacy groups called for senators to closely scrutinize Tobias' credentials and philosophy and determine whether, given his past ties to the industry, he will be able to fight on behalf of the millions of poor HIV/AIDS victims in desperate need of cheap anti-retroviral drugs in the face of opposition from the major western pharmaceutical companies, often referred to as Big Pharma. "This decision is another deeply disturbing sign that the President may not be prepared to fulfill his pledge to take emergency action on AIDS," noted Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance. "It raises serious questions of conflict of interest and the priorities of the White House."  "Both the people of Africa and the people of the United States will lose if the president's AIDS initiative fails to use the lowest-cost, generic medications," Zeitz said, noting that the pharmaceutical companies have successfully pressed the Bush administration to go back on an earlier pledge to carve out an exception in international patent laws that would enable needy countries to import generic anti-AIDS drugs.  Others were openly scornful about the appointment. "We know he has little experience with AIDS, but lots as a major Republican donor," said Salih Booker, director of Africa Action, a Washington-based fusion of several long-standing anti-apartheid groups. "This is where U.S. policy on AIDS is; it's with Big Pharma."  A corporate executive throughout his career, Tobias has no background in public health and little or no experience with working in poor countries. In short remarks at the White House Tuesday, he described the statistics of the AIDS toll taken in Africa--where almost 20 million people have been killed by the disease--as "really nearly incomprehensible."  At the same time, Tobias is known as a no-nonsense businessman who is particularly close to the recently departed director of the administration's Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a bureaucracy that could play a key role in securing the money to actually fund Bush's $15-billion program.  "This is clearly a person with tremendous stature and management acumen," said Sandra Thurman, who served as former President Clinton's global AIDS director and now heads the International AIDS Trust.     Three Questions  The key test for many activists, however, will lie in how Tobias responds to three major questions regarding the Bush administration's global AIDS policies, of which Emergency Program is the central feature.  The first concern involves the availability of generic anti-AIDS and other life-saving drugs to poor countries under the Program. While major pharmaceutical companies have sharply cut prices on their brand-name anti-viral medicines for AIDS victims in poor African countries, similar generic drugs produced in India, Thailand, and Brazil, for example, still cost significantly less--as little as under $300 per person per year for triple combinations of anti-retroviral drugs.  While the administration has suggested it will use generics in the Emergency Program, it has not been made a formal decision. "Tobias will have tough questions to answer about whether the Bush AIDS Plan will make efficient use of funds by maximizing purchases of affordable generic medicines," noted Eustacia Smith of Health Global Access Project (Health GAP).  A related question is whether Tobias will push the administration to follow through on its promise at the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Doha in November 2001 to permit poor countries that face public-health emergencies to import generic anti-AIDS and other life-saving drugs.  Under pressure from Big Pharma, the administration has since reversed its position by pressing its bilateral trade partners in Africa to sign agreements committing them to respect international patent laws that, from a practical viewpoint, would make importing generics much more problematic.  "It's very difficult to believe that a man coming from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry would be willing to respond to the calls from impoverished countries to expedite access to life-saving mechanisms," said Zeitz. "Purchase of lowest-cost medicines, including generics, is a must," according to Asia Russell of Health GAP. "The pharmaceutical industry calls that piracy. Which side will Tobias be on?"  Finally, activists are particularly worried about the fate of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, a two-year-old multilateral mechanism to expedite the funding of anti-AIDS work around the world. Although Congress has authorized an annual contribution of up to $1 billion for the Fund--which is already fast running out of money--the administration has said it intends to provide only $200 million a year.  Big Pharma has been cited as a major culprit behind the administration's niggardliness towards the Fund because of its support for making generic anti-AIDS drugs accessible to all needy countries.  "Whether Tobias will push within the administration for the funding the Global Fund really needs to even begin to catch up with the need will be critical test of whether he's independent," said Booker.

AIDS in Africa and Black America. By Kwei Quartey, October 11, 2012  Thirty years ago, the CDC reported the first cases of HIV/AIDS in New York and Los Angeles. Initially thought to be a disease of gay white men, AIDS is now a global epidemic. Thirty-three million people worldwide were living with AIDS in 2010, with sub-Saharan Africa bearing the brunt.   Since the beginning of the epidemic, over 600,000 people have died of AIDS in the United States, and 1.2 million people are currently living with HIV. About a fifth of them are unaware of their infection and pose a risk of onward transmission. Estimates indicate an infection rate of approximately 56,000 a year in the United States.  AIDS in Africa  It is thought that a strain of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) in a number of chimpanzee colonies in Cameroon was the viral ancestor of HIV-1, which causes AIDS in humans. The assertion that HIV originated in Africa is politically sensitive, with some believing that the western scientists have falsely blamed Africa for a disease that really began in the United States.  Whatever its origins, HIV/AIDS became a severe epidemic in East Africa in the 1980s. In Nairobi, Kenya, HIV prevalence among sex workers rose 15-fold between 1981 and 1985. African doctors were facing a disease with signs and symptoms similar to those observed in gay white American men, but 80 percent of cases in Africa were due to heterosexual activity, with a higher prevalence in women.   The initial response by African governments to the AIDS crisis was inadequate, and in some cases absent. In South Africa, where the epidemic has become the largest in the world with over 5 million HIV-infected people, white leaders refused to implement an AIDS education program. They did not begin to consider the danger of a large-scale heterosexual HIV/AIDS epidemic until the end of the 1980s.   The World Health Organization initially regarded HIV/AIDS in Africa as relatively unimportant compared with malaria, but by 1993ówhen an estimated 9 million sub-Saharan African people were HIV-positiveóit was clear that this was a massive crisis. By the late 1990s, triple combination therapy with antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) was clearly making a difference in western countries, but the cost to an African would be an impossible $10,000-15,000 per person annually. South Africa began to lobby intransigent multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical companies to allow the drugs to be produced locally. In December 1999, President Bill Clinton announced to the embattled World Trade Organization conference in Seattle that the United States would seek flexibility in the patent laws that were keeping drug prices high.  In the 2000s, the cost of ARVs decreased. However, doubts were expressed that Africans would be able to adhere to multi-dose ARV regimens. In a statement that would be widely criticized, USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios stated in an interview with the Boston Globe that ''Africans don't know what Western time is. Ö Many people in Africa have never seen a clock or a watch their entire lives.î  In 2003, President George W. Bush announced the unprecedented President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the goal of which was to help save the lives of those suffering from HIV/AIDS around the world. With PEPFAR and greater availability of ARVs, AIDS-related mortality began to decline in sub-Saharan Africa in 2005. In the past 10 years, the number of new HIV infections has dropped by more than 25 percent in 22 countries in the region, including some with the largest number of cases.  AIDS in Black America  While the number of new HIV infections has substantially dropped in sub-Saharan Africa, it has changed very little in the United States, especially in African-American communities. Indeed, although black Americans represent just 13 percent of the U.S. population, they account for almost 50 percent of Americans living with HIV/AIDS and 40 percent of total deaths to date. The estimated lifetime risk of becoming HIV-infected is 1 in 16 for black males, 1 in 30 for black females, 1 in 104 for white males, and 1 in 588 for white females.  Phill Wilson, founder and executive director of the Black AIDS Institute, points out that if black America were a country, it would rank 16th in the world for HIV infection. In Washington, D.C., where three-quarters of those infected are black and the infection rate doubled for black women between 2008 and 2010, HIV prevalence stands at almost 3 percentóa higher rate than the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, and several other sub-Saharan countries.   In the PBS program ìEndgame: AIDS in Black America,î Gregorio Millett, a senior policy adviser to the Office of National AIDS Policy, says, ìWeíve been running in place in many waysÖwe have spent 30 years with a completely uncoordinated response for HIV. Even though we were requiring other countries that we were funding to have a national HIV/AIDS strategy, the U.S. never had a national HIV/AIDS strategy ourselves.î  PEPFARís goal was to share with the world the best practices established in the United States during the first 20 years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, as PEPFAR approaches the end of its first decade, the program can now do the reverse: apply best practices from abroad to the United States, particularly in poor, black populations.  Concrete examples bear this out. Notwithstanding Natsiosí declaration, studies in sub-Saharan Africa have shown ARV adherence rates of greater than 90 percent, while adherence to HIV medications stands at only 60-70 percent in the United States. The African success appears to be due to several factors, among them the use of effective peer-to-peer counseling and systems that are community-based rather than individually focused. The PEPFAR approach, although not perfect, strongly suggests that such approaches would be beneficial in poverty-stricken areas of cities such as Washington, D.C.  PEPFAR advocates shifting responsibility for HIV testing and counseling away from overwhelmed healthcare providers to community and lay health workers. In PEPFAR programs, the wide availability of patient counseling through community health networks and strong family-based support are integral to achieving medication adherence.Counseling is provided in the community at several levels of the health network, including nurses, pharmacists, and other providers, and individuals are connected to peer support networks of other people living with HIV/AIDS.  In the United States, HIV infection is often seen only through a medical prism, but PEPFAR has shown that social support is a vital part of rendering care to people living with the disease. For example, low-income populations in urban areas must wrestle with issues such as homelessness and drug use, which complicate adherence to treatment.  Distant Africa may seem to have little relevance to the United States, but now the ìDark Continentî is shining a light on a way out of the worst epidemic in history.

Curing AIDS Policy of Greed and Dogma. By Yifat Susskind. Edited by John Feffer, November 30, 2006  A whole generation into the AIDS pandemic, we now have significant (though still insufficient) knowledge of how to combat the disease. But while the world's collective understanding is gradually advancing, U.S. AIDS policy remains mired in a right-wing economic and social vision that is curtailing progress and costing lives.  In fact, the politics that drive U.S. AIDS policy--and sexual and reproductive health policy in general--have swung so far to the right that many in the United States are no longer outraged by the truly outrageous. Something that once would have sounded utterly insane, like requiring health clinics around the world to sign a loyalty oath condemning prostitution, today passes for business as usual.  But as public debate shifts to the right, we should refuse to drift with it. Last month's election of a Democratic Congress offers some hope, but only if we succeed in shifting public debate onto more reasonable ground. One place to begin is to recognize how financial greed, religious dogma, and hostility toward women's rights are fueling AIDS policy. Then we can begin to address the gap between what AIDS policy is and what it should be.  Greed and Dogma  After another three million AIDS deaths this year around the world, the Bush administration is still prioritizing pharmaceutical industry profits over people's access to medicine. Patents that allow drug companies based in the United States and Europe to control the manufacture and sale of AIDS medicines prevent countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America from providing people with cheaper, generic AIDS drugs (even though 95% of AIDS patients are in those countries). Meanwhile, the nine largest US drug companies turned a profit of nearly $43 billion dollars last year--more than the gross national income of some of the worst AIDS-affected countries.  The latest trend, embodied by Bill Clinton, is to haggle with drug companies for reduced prices or donations. But charity is not what the countries of the Global South are asking for.  Nor are they asking for religious dogma. Today, a full one-third of international U.S. AIDS prevention funding is mandated for programs that promote either abstinence or fidelity as prevention strategies. Condoms are decried as a "last resort." But moralizing about abstinence does not reduce the spread of HIV. On the contrary, in Uganda, it took only two years for HIV rates to double after U.S. missionaries-turned-policymakers effectively shifted the emphasis of the country's AIDS prevention programs from condom use to abstinence.  Yet Bush continues to favor right-wing Christian organizations that preach abstinence in disbursing federal AIDS funding. He has stacked his Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS with religious fundamentalists and incompetent ideologues. This year's notable appointment was of Herbert Lusk, a vocally anti-gay pastor with no HIV-related experience. And just last month, Bush picked Eric Keroack--who opposes birth control--to head the family planning programs at the Department of Health and Human Services. Keroack believes that publicly funded sexual education should consist almost entirely of abstinence promotion.  Contempt for Women's Rights  Current U.S. AIDS policy gives drug companies control over treatment options and allows religious fundamentalists to dominate prevention strategies. This union of greed and dogma has produced an AIDS policy that undermines women's human rights at a time when HIV infects more women than ever before.  The drug industry's hostility towards generics is disproportionately harmful to women, who represent the majority of the world's poor. Their health so often neglected within families and communities, women have the least access to costly AIDS medicines. The abstinence-and-fidelity mantra of the religious right endangers women by ignoring the fact that many women lack the power to refuse sex--especially from their husbands. In sub-Saharan Africa, where 65% of this year's new HIV infections occurred, being married actually increased a woman's chance of contracting the virus.  And the fundamentalist attack on abortion rights--which now permeates U.S. international health policy--continues to fuel the spread of AIDS. The "global gag rule" has pulled U.S. funding from any health organization that provides information about abortion. As a result, clinics that once offered a range of critical health services--including AIDS treatment and prevention programs for women in some of the poorest countries--have been forced to close.  Choice, Not Charity  Everything we know about combating the AIDS pandemic points to the need for a synthesis of prevention and treatment strategies within a human rights framework. It's not Bono's or Oprah's job to develop and enact those strategies. Safeguarding public health and upholding human rights are the responsibility of government. Rather than a fundamentalist fantasy of stamping out sex, AIDS prevention strategies should be grounded in what we know works: education and access to condoms within a framework that promotes women's and girls' rights to negotiate sex and make the best choices for their well-being.  To realize those goals, federal AIDS programs should rely on generic AIDS medicines--which, at a fraction of the cost of patented brands, are the key to ensuring universal access to treatment. Reluctant corporate charity is no way to fight the worst epidemic in recorded history. Rather, like food and water, medicine should be excluded from World Trade Organization patent rules. The United States has already agreed to this demand in trade talks held in Doha in 2001.  We need to hold the administration to its promise. That means renegotiating recent trade deals, such as the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), that skirt commitments made in Doha and prevent governments from providing generic drugs to people living with AIDS. And since CAFTA passed by such a slim margin last year, November's victories may offer a real possibility for future trade deals that actually comply with U.S. obligations to allow the manufacture and sale of generic medicines.  Next fiscal year's HIV/AIDS budget should reflect the U.S. commitment to fund its fair share of the UN Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria. The Global Fund--which relies on generic medicines, operates within a human rights framework, and facilitates international cooperation--is the best-situated institution for combating the spread of AIDS worldwide.  Now that the Democrats control both houses of Congress, we should push for another vote to repeal the "global gag rule." Last year, the Senate voted to rescind it, but the measure never made it past the House. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) has also introduced a bill to repeal the requirement that one-third of U.S. HIV/AIDS prevention funding be dedicated to programs that prescribe abstinence. It calls on the president and the Global AIDS Coordinator to develop a comprehensive strategy to address the impact of HIV/AIDS on women and girls.  And U.S. policy should be brought into compliance with the action plan developed by public health and women's rights advocates at the 1994 UN Conference on Population and Development.  You don't need to memorize the latest UN AIDS report to know that corporate greed and religious dogma are no substitute for a human rights-based international AIDS policy. That should be our message to the new and improved Congress this World AIDS Day.

How to Stop AIDS Now. Back in the 1980s, AIDS activists employed this technique of “birdogging” (going to the public appearance of a target and trying to get him or her to commit to a new policy) to put the HIV/AIDS crisis on the map. We were preparing to use the same strategy. Now, however, our demand was not limited to just domestic policy, but rather has evolved, as the global epidemic has evolved,  to demand that our foreign policy has to act on the international HIV/AIDS crisis. More specifically, in this particular instance, our goal was targeted at Presidential hopefuls Obama and Edwards to get them to commit to $50 billion dollars over the next 5 years to fight AIDS, a funding level that experts agree will be needed to turn the tide of the AIDS epidemic. Obama spoke first and during a pause in his speech we all stood up with the signs and chanted, “Beat the GOP on AIDS and HIV, $50 billion now!” After a few repetitions, he signaled for us to sit back down, which we did; he told the audience to clap for us, which they did. He then commended our effort; and proceeded to talk about HIV/AIDS in his speech. After his speech, we rushed for the “handshake” line to seize the opportunity to shake his hand and go one step further: a firm commitment. We asked if he would support $50 billion over the next 5 years for HIV/AIDS; he stated that he had already confirmed his support for more HIV/AIDS funding, but would not give a definitive answer on our specific demand. Mission Unaccomplished. John Edwards spoke next, and we deployed almost exactly the same strategy with him; he proved enormously receptive to us and afterwards in the handshake line, affirmed a couple of times that yes, he would support $50 billion over the next five years for HIV/AIDS. And so John Edwards became the second of seventeen Democratic and Republican candidates to say that he would support the money, and the only top tier one to do so (Senator Joe Biden has also committed to funding the $50 billion needed). Mission Accomplished (well, for that day at least). The ’08 Stop AIDS Platform The ’08 Stop AIDS Platform is something that we must all take heed of: our next President must do more to stop the HIV/AIDS crisis. This conviction is what impelled this group of 15 youth AIDS activists to attend the Take Back America Conference in Washington, D.C. earlier this summer and “birddog” Barack Obama and John Edwards. In 2005, at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, the leaders of the world’s most powerful countries promised Universal Access to AIDS Treatment by 2010. However, as of today, no concrete plans to make this goal actually come to fruition have been developed. As global leaders stall at their commitment, everyday another 15,000 people become infected with HIV and 8,200 people die from the disease. The rhetoric spoken at the G8 Summit must turn into action – and it is up to us to make our next president step up and keep our share of the promise for treatment access. The ’08 Stop AIDS Platform, written by a coalition of nearly a dozen US organizations in consultation with people in impoverished countries and supported by over 127 national and international organizations, is based on the premise that our politicians need to keep their promise and devise and implement a plan so treatment access for the millions of people affected by HIV/AIDS becomes a reality. The platform states: “More than 40 million are living with HIV worldwide, and each year more than three million people die from AIDS. By 2010, there will be as many as 20 million children orphaned by AIDS. The infection rates in some impoverished countries are greater than 33%, and the impact of AIDS poses major humanitarian challenge to the United States. Within the United States, HIV/AIDS is disproportionately affecting people of color, and prevention and treatment are still underfunded; strong leadership is needed to defeat the epidemic. Global health diplomacy provides one key opportunity to renew internationally our ties to the world community. America's place in history will be determined by how well we respond to this still-expanding crisis at home and abroad.” The ’08 Stop AIDS Platform calls for a new vision on U.S. HIV/AIDS policy, a chief component of which is to provide $50 billion by 2013 to fight HIV/AIDS, and to double the number of people on treatment supported by the United States from two million to four million. This number represents one-third of the people living with AIDS and in immediate need of treatment – as the U.S. represents one-third of the world’s wealth, it follows that we should be responsible for providing treatment for one-third of the people who need it.  Our Government’s Policies If our next president committed to this platform, it would represent a markedly different path for AIDS funding than the one the United States is currently on. Our signs read, “Beat the GOP on AIDS and HIV” because our targets at that moment belonged to the Democratic Party. Our message, however, is the same to all of the candidates, regardless of political party: the current U.S. policies toward HIV/AIDS are woefully inadequate. This is especially the case with President Bush’s recent announcement of to reauthorize PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), which allocates $30 billion over the next 5 years for HIV/AIDS funding. While at face value this may seem like a substantial commitment – and indeed, it is being lauded by some as a doubling of the $15 billion in the original PEPFAR – to hold that view is to possess a misunderstanding of the facts. The original PEPFAR, announced in 2003, aimed to prevent 7 million new infections and treat 2 million people (1/3 of those in need of treatment). The $15 billion has been given in increasing increments each year – in 2003 only $1.2 billion dollars was given to global AIDS, but this year Bush has requested $5.8 billion and Congress is expected to appropriate $6 billion. However, in the new PEPFAR announcement, funding will essentially be flat-lined, giving around $6 billion every year, and leaving no room for needed scale-up. Moreover, the program aims to treat 2.5 million people by 2013. Remember: by the end of 2008 under the old PEPFAR, we aim to treat 2 million. Yet by 2013, under the new PEPFAR, the goal is 2.5 million; this number simply does not keep up with the projected rate of infections. Unfortunately, the number of people in need of treatment is only increasing, and UNAIDS projects that over 10 million people will be in need of treatment by 2010. If the US is to keep to our commitment of treating 1/3 of those in need and to fighting this pandemic, then the amount of money that we give must increase; the US share must increase to $50 billion. The Future The original PEPFAR announcement came in large part as a result of pressure from AIDS activists demanding that more be done to combat HIV/AIDS. Right now it is imperative to the lives of millions of people that HIV/AIDS become an important issue in the next election. More importantly, though, it is crucial that the next president not just talk about AIDS but commit to a specific, comprehensive plan to fight AIDS. As such, it is vital to make sure that all of the candidates know that one of the key pieces needed to fight AIDS is adequate funding: $50 billion dollars over the next 5 years. HIV/AIDS is a crisis of our time, and we must stand up and address it. So pay attention to what the candidates are saying about HIV/AIDS – and remember that you can use your voice to demand change.
